_For more information, read the full announcement on_ [**MoonPay**](https://www.moonpay.com/newsroom/ens).

**Project Highlights**

[**nftychat**](https://nftychat.xyz/) | @slobo.eth

* Slobo introduced nftychat's newest feature and attendees of the call were able to claim free `nfty.eth` subdomains.

\--

[**Unblock Receipts**](https://www.unblockreceipts.com/) | @unblockreceipts.eth

* Fileverse is a decentralized alternative to Notion & Gsuite tools.
* The UI is stored on IPFS, chat is end-to-end encrypted, and access is filtered at the address level. This means no email or KYC is needed to collaborate, and access can be token-gated or whitelisted.
* Donate via [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x64e5b2228ef31437909900b38fc42dd5e4b83147/0x64e5b2228ef31437909900b38fc42dd5e4b83147-9).

\--

**Unruggable Subname Rentals** | @Premm.eth and @clowestab

* Premm and Thomas are looking to make changes around 3 current limitations of subname rentals.
  1. There is a single parent level "renewal controller."
  2. Subnames in the name wrapper can be hard to verify as "unruggable."
  3. Burning the fuse of a wrapped domain carries a high degree of risk for the parent domain holder.
* The project introduces the idea of a renewal controller that manages the price of renewals. An independent 3rd party in this case could control the price of renewals and prevent price hikes on current subname holders.
* Donate via [Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x64e5b2228ef31437909900b38fc42dd5e4b83147/0x64e5b2228ef31437909900b38fc42dd5e4b83147-34).
