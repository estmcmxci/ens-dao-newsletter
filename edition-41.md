### üî® [Meta-Governance](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/meta-governance/28)

**The Meta-Governance working group hosted its weekly meetings on August 1st, 2023 and August 8th, 2023:**

* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting ‚Äî August 1st](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-11am-et-tuesday/15981/32?u=estmcmxci)
* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting ‚Äî August 8th](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-11am-et-tuesday/15981/32?u=estmcmxci)

‚Äî

#### Request for Feedback

The Meta-Governance stewards encourage the ENS community to participate in improving the Protocol by visiting ens.canny.io; it serves as a dedicated platform to collect user feedback, feature requests, integrations, and bug reports. The tool's upvoting feature, when widely utilized, can significantly boost community involvement and development. ENS Labs and Working Group stewards have visibility over submissions, and will work to ensure the appropriate parties are notified of submissions. ‚Äî 08.03.23

‚Äî

#### Executable Proposal: Refund .eth names affected by normalization updates

A new [Executable Proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-refund-eth-names-affected-by-normalization-updates/17622) has been drafted by @alisha.eth and @matoken.eth, the proposal focuses on issuing refunds for fees spent on .eth names that may be negatively affected by updates to the name normalization standard passed in EP 3.7, which relates to ENSIP-15: Name Normalization. Alisha will poll delegates to get an idea of what option they would support being included in an Executable Proposal. If there is no consensus, a Temp Check may be posted on the ENS Snapshot space. The proposal may be put to a vote by the end of August, if not September. ‚Äî 08.10.23

‚Äî

#### Security Advisory

@Nick.eth [recently addressed a technical issue](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/security-advisory-a-malicious-dao-update-could-reduce-the-registration-duration-of-registered-eth-2lds/17576) present in the ethregistrar controller, which also impacts the Namewrapper ‚Äî they have prepared a solution that, if deployed, would introduce a new admin contract to shield against any possible exploitation. Implementing this patch introduces added complexity to contracts, however. Amounting to an increase of 3,000 gas, which translates to an added cost of 28c at 50 gwei.

Meta-Governance stewards encourage discourse to address the issue at large, the goal with which is to collect feedback and subsequently initiate an off-chain temp check to determine the best approach. The ENS Community, **especially those with relevant technical experience**, are urged to actively participate: to comment on threads, engage in conversations, reflect on the matter, and put forth discussion topics sooner rather than during the voting period. ‚Äî 08.01.23

‚Äî

#### Endaoment / Governance Dashboards

[Karpatkey](https://karpatkey.com), DAO treasury and risk management, have issued the [ENS Endaoment dashboard](https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=3\&month=7\&year=2023), featuring a detailed outlook on overall treasury management including balance overview, treasury mix, token allocation and more. They've published a Dune [Dashboard](https://dune.com/karpatkey/ens-dao-governance-metrics) as well, which details Governance analytics and aims to be an open and consolidated source of information about governance data. The financial report will be available both on the [forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-monthly-reports/17614) and on the Karpatkey website. Check out this helpful [thread](https://twitter.com/TheCapHimself/status/1689260756561502208?s=20) by @cap for a detailed breakdown ‚Äî 08.09.23

‚Äî

#### Treasury Diversification

@5pence.eth initiated a discussion regarding the diversification into Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) beyond Lido Protocol. The primary focus was understanding the goals, especially in light of the newly approved endowment strategies.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

* The current plan is to gradually shift the stakeETH position into Rocketpool.
* The immediate objective is to maintain a portfolio with 20% in Rocketpool and 80% in Lido. This distribution is mainly influenced by liquidity considerations.
* A more extensive debate took place about Lido's market share and its implications for network risk.

@Nick.eth strongly advocated for validator diversity. He stressed the importance decentralization and recommended considering other trustworthy staking providers. @alextnetto.eth pointed out that spreading across multiple LSTs might help in reducing slippage. Stewards are considering a soft proposal to limit up to 50% allocation to LSTs to prevent asset concentration. Karpatkey took the responsibility to analyze the potential implications of capping Lido's share at 50%. They will further investigate its feasibility and safety aspects and provide feedback. ‚Äî 08.08.23

‚Äî

#### Rethinking ENS Small Grants

Historically, small grants have placed a significant demand on delegates. The objective is to devise new voting methods for these grants, independent of delegates who've already contributed to Working Group funding decisions.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Voting Mechanism: Investigate non-ENS token-dependent voting.
* Sybil Security: Utilize Gitcoin passport and multiple layers of sybil resistance.
* Integration: Combine voting with platforms like Snapshot and maintain specific ENS records.
* Engaging Voters: Engage diverse groups, from builders to developers and prior grant winners, in the voting process.
* Snapshot & POAP Strategy: Incorporate a blend of Snapshot, weighted POAPs, and approval voting. Aim to condense POAP categories to 2-3 types.
* Timeline: September is the targeted month for rollout, with a focus on potentially implementing a POAP strategy.

Looking ahead, Working Group stewards will work to asses past strategies' effectiveness and aim for a sybil-resistant voting method that encourages high-impact, high-context contributors to participate in the voting rounds, irrespective of their $ENS balance. Alisha.eth has opened a [thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/rethinking-ens-small-grants/17607) where ENS community members are encouraged to participate in the discussion. ‚Äî 08.08.23

‚Äî

#### Funding The Commons

The Public Goods Working Group is proud to sponsor the "Funding The Commons" event. Following the success of a similar event they've hosted in Paris, they are now bringing the event to Berlin. To learn more, visit their website ‚Äî fundingthecommons.io. This event features a virtual hackathon where hackers can take on challenges and earn bounties. The stewards are currently seeking collaborators for a specific bounty related to Public Goods. If interested, reach out to @Coltron.eth for more information. ‚Äî 08.08.23

‚Äî

#### ENSIP-14 and Affiliate Marketing

Discussion on [ENSIP-14](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-14-platform-source-parameter) continues; originally proposed by @avsa as an on-chain source parameter which tracks how platforms register names, the conversation eventually evolved into a broader affiliate program which would incentivize individuals or entities to promote ENS and drive more registrations and renewals. @lightwalker.eth has since led [discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-affiliate-marketing-affiliate-program/11819/53?u=estmcmxci) on the topic and has suggested to open further discourse on the matter on separate, regularly held meetings. More detail about the proposal can be found [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ensip14-proposal-double-ens-integration-incentives/17543/5?u=estmcmxci) as well as some further insight from @taytems on its [implementation](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ensip14-proposal-double-ens-integration-incentives/17543/4?u=estmcmxci). ‚Äî 08.06.23

‚Äî

#### Future of the Primary ENS Name

As L2 scaling solutions gain ecosystem adoption, the importance of Primary Names as a "Web 3 username" comes into focus. @Premm.eth has presented a comprehensive proposal emphasizing the adoption of off-chain primary names. This proposal also introduces a fallback system, which can function either off-chain, on L2, or L1. However, the technical nuances still need clarity. It's recommended that a dedicated session be scheduled to delve deeper into the technical aspects of primary names. Follow the [discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/future-of-the-primary-ens-name/16337). ‚Äî 08.10.23

‚Äî

#### Developer Updates

Gasless DNSSEC is nearing its test phase on the testnet. This feature will introduce Gasless Imports, allowing users to import domain names without the burden of gas fees, which currently range between $200 to $500. The significance of enabling gasless imports for DNS and the capability to set primary names across multiple chains cannot be overstated.

The newsletter will now be published bi-weekly (Tuesday) at 11 am Eastern Time on the forum, Paragraph and on the DAOs socials (tl;dr).

#### Project Highlight: Persona

[Femi - adebimpe.xyz](https://twitter.com/fem1bimpe) introduced the Persona platform, inspired by Nouns and emphasizing community engagement with DAO-like structures. Members assume roles denoted by guild tags, which confer specific community access. Users can manage multiple personas, each linked to a guild tag. Active participation boosts persona reputation, enhancing community influence.

The platform lets users create their own communities or DAOs, determine community tokens, enlist members, and form guilds, with an auction feature for fundraising. Persona uniquely integrates with ENS for metadata and offers NFT-based avatar customization. Femi aims to launch Persona publicly late this year or early next. ‚Äî 08.10.23
