#### Forbes | [How Ethereum Shapes Identity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/10/how-ethereum-is-shaping-global-identity/?sh=16fde2764560)

Chris Castiglione of CONSOLE DAO published an editorial discussing the future of identity with Ethereum, featuring ENS as a center point of discussion:

> The Ethereum Name System (ENS) offers users a decentralized, human-readable naming system that maps Ethereum wallet addresses to ENS names. These names, such as ‚Äúcastig.eth,‚Äù offer users a secure and private way to identify themselves online, without having to remember long, complicated wallet addresses. ENS operates in a similar way to domain names and is based on blockchain and cryptographic technologies. The aim is to create a global passport for the internet that offers users self-sovereign identity, meaning they own their identities instead of renting them. ENS Labs and the Ethereum Foundation have sponsored the Sign-in With Ethereum initiative to provide an open-source alternative to traditional login verification services from companies such as Apple, Facebook, and Google. Other competitors in the self-sovereign identity naming space include BNS and Lens, but ENS is the largest and best established, with over 2.7 million active ENS names held by 663,000 participants. -- [Forbes, 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/10/how-ethereum-is-shaping-global-identity/?sh=16fde2764560)

### üîí Security Tip

There has been a recent influx of _promoted_ advertisements for crypto scams on Twitter.

The ads appear to be from reputable names including Optimism, zkSync, Ocean, and more, and almost always claim to announce some type of **airdrop** or giveaway.

These are fake news.

‚ö†Ô∏è **REMEMBER**

* _**NEVER give your private seed phrase to anyone, or enter it into any website, for any reason.**_ Your seed phrase has the same function as your password, and with it an attacker is granted complete access to your crypto assets.
* **There is no second airdrop!** Anything that says there is - even in what appears to be from a legitimate source - is **lying to you,** and wants to steal your crypto!
