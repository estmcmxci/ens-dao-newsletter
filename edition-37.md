### ‚öôÔ∏è ENS Development and Integrations

#### Integration: Farcaster x ENS

Farcaster, a "sufficiently decentralizied" Web3 social protocol has [announced](https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1669727329843658752?s=20) that they are upgrading Farcaster usernames to be compliant with ENS. They are planning to add .eth username support for users that prefer to use their existing ENS name.

‚Äî

#### Integration: Zapper x ENS

Zapper, the social web3 explorer, has [announced](https://twitter.com/zapper\_fi/status/1671976058948849664?s=20) their integration with ENS, enabling users to view their avatar, description, and socials of addresses with ENS profiles, all in one place.

Try it out [now](https://zapper.xyz).

‚Äî

#### Integration: Etherscan x ENS

ENS and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) have integrated their platforms to improve user experience and streamline the process of accessing .eth domain names on Etherscan. Users can now search for .eth domain names directly on Etherscan, and clicking on a search result will take them directly to the associated address page on Etherscan. This integration aims to make ENS more accessible and user-friendly within the Ethereum ecosystem.

‚Äî

#### UX Development: Primary Name Flow

@domico.eth (product designer) [announced](https://twitter.com/domicoeth/status/1671267907345747969?s=20) a significant update that simplifies the process of changing primary names. The update includes gas savings, improved user experience, and new functionality. The new UX displays all potentially valid names, optimizes transactions to minimize gas costs, allows users to unset their primary name directly within the app, with clear explanations on how to do so. ‚Äî

#### ENS + IPFS Deployment on Fleek

@matoken.eth (developer) provides a guide on deploying websites to ENS+IPFS, which involves converting the website into a Single Page App (SPA) and setting up Continuous Integration (CI) on Fleek. They also explain the process of setting up an SSL certificate, mentioning that SSL certificates are already in place for second-level ENS names.

In total, the Public Goods working group received 38 submissions, categorized as follows:

* Education (19)
* Tools (12)
* Infrastructure (7)

### üåê Community Updates

#### Immutable ENS Websites

Developed by @gregskril (developer) at ETH Global (Waterloo), this project aims to address concerns related to accessing the Tornado Cash website after a DAO attack. The idea proposes a versioned approach to deploying decentralized frontends for web3 protocols in order to ensure the integrity of their contents. Instead of relying on dynamic domain names like tornadocash.eth.limo, the proposal suggests deploying static versions such as v1.tornadocash.eth, v2.tornadocash.eth, and so on, with each version locked and unchangeable.

The goal is to create decentralized websites that contain mission-critical information and require minimal updates. The implementation involves utilizing the ENS NameWrapper, along with a resolver and subname renewal manager contracts created by @serenae, to tie everything together. The project's frontend is built using Vite, React, RainbowKit, viem, wagmi, and thorin for design, while the core functionality relies on IPFS and ENS.

#### 1W3: June Updates

1W3 is a decentralized web platform that serves as an alternative to Linktree. It provides users with a personalized and censorship-resistant hub to showcase their identity and creations. Users have complete control over their digital presence, free from centralized control. They can integrate various elements such as social profiles, portfolios, blogs, NFTs, videos, podcasts, photos, calendars, and more, all on a single customizable page.

Future developments include:

1. Arweave Permastorage integration
2. Image gallery feature
3. YouTube video embedding

#### DAO Minimalism

During a recent ENS DAO space, @brantlymillegan [articulated a vision](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1669764751021203457?s=20) for DAOs to prioritize simplicity and focus solely on essential governance activities critical to the protocol's functioning. The overarching objective of this approach was to streamline operations, optimize efficiency, and foster effective governance within the DAO ecosystem.
