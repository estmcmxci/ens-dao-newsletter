#### The 10k Club

This past week the 10k Club purchased all variations of 000-999 and 0000-9999! The event generated around 3 million USD for DAO funds and contributed to the DAO racing towards to 1 million names registered mark!

### ENS DAO Governance

**EP9:** Onchain voting has been passed and executed on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x323A76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2A560C6a395b7E3/proposal/107166664722174233740232174220463354481004128961821575530758100250899337476509)! This proposal replaced the legacy price oracle with one that uses an exponential decay for expired names - meaning their premium will start at $100M and halve daily for 21 days until reaching zero. View the the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe040bdae812af4bd5b3b6e3f46ed1ff4701986c338b827ac8f05807c2b9b9d73) for more information.

**EP10:** Community member @rocco has provided [Updates on EP10 - Community Run Identity Server (Mid-April)](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updates-on-ep10-community-run-identity-server-mid-april/11996)

**EP11:** Onchain voting is underway on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x323A76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2A560C6a395b7E3/proposal/99882233577221676057992280816078245519848378270443751235073826886360950537295)!

Check out a screenshot of the [Zenhub Dashboard](https://discuss.ens.domains/uploads/db9688/original/2X/0/04b3cec011423112e7f65bda1a57b52db20a2160.png).
