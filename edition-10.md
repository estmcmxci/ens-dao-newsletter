### **👋 Hello!**

Hello and welcome to the Ethereum Name Service DAO Newsletter!

As always, new editions are **published on the 1st and 15th of every month.**

This newsletter is available on the [ENS DAO Governance Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/), [Substack](https://ensdaonews.substack.com/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ensdaonews).

We encourage any feedback, questions, or comments!

#### 📰 ENS Newsletter Update

The ENS Newsletter is an important function of the ENS DAO. It helps inform Delegates, Stewards, Contributors and Speculators of what work is currently being completed within the DAO. Syndicating this information ensures the longterm sustainability and continued productivity of the DAO.

The ENS Newsletter today consists of the following sections:

1. DAOwide Updates
2. Working Group News
3. Community News
4. Protocol Development
5. DAO Metrics
6. Volunteer call-to-action

Over the course of Term 2, the ENS Newsletter will transition into the ENS Blog, which will consist of a variety of editorial content including the Newsletter as well as Contributor Spotlights, DAO2DAO Features, and Community Highlights.

There are many emergent communities stemming from DAO activities such as the 10k club, ENS Queens, and more. In order to create a more coherent culture, the ENS Blog will act as a medium for Community exchange which will help to establish shared perceptions of the ENS DAO and the TNL Vision.

### 📰 Working Group News

#### ⚖️ [Meta-Governance](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/meta-governance/28)

The Meta-Governance Working Group hosted its first meeting of Term 2 on July 12th, 2022 at 7PM UTC. The following topics were discussed:

**I. Coordinating Time and Meetings**

The time of the Meta-Gov calls will be on **Monday at 3PM EST.** An update to the master calendar will be posted with a link for the new call times. The DAO is working on setting up a Google Workspace to enable uniform meeting permissions. The DAO will use one meeting link for DAO-wide calls.

**II. Establishing Working Group Mission and Intentions**

MG Stewards will work towards establishing coherence in the Governance process through the creation of processes and standards. Stewards will focus on the creation of better documentation and streamlined processes. There will also be a focus on improving DAO Tools, specifically the creation of better Discourse plug-ins that show voting/delegation records.

**III. Continued discussion**

From the Stewards:

* A priority should be getting a governance flow in place, so we have an established reference point to fall pack on and ultimately reduce friction in productive communication.
* It was discussed to put forward a budget to reimburse gas costs. The MG Stewards supported this pending technical viability and a way to produce the transactions.
* The MG stewards will begin determining what processes from the last term need to be improved, so we can identify what changes need to be made and track the progress of these changes.

Update: There is currently a DAOwide tempcheck taking place on the forum. You can find the link to the discussion [here.](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/reimbursing-onchain-voters/13660)

_Attendees: coltron.eth, nick.eth, simona.eth, slobo.eth, Alex Michaelson, Ashu, alisha.eth, oakgroup.eth, anthonyware, carlosdp.eth_

#### 🔄[ Ecosystem](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-ecosystem/32)

**II. Budget:**

The Working Groups are soliciting input for initiatives and budget requests for this next term. There is a forum [post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/term-2-wg-budget-initiative-requests/13639?u=estmcmxci) where community members can respond.

**III. Devcon Bogota:**

The Stewards are targeting Devcon in Colombia for their next IRL conference attendance. Devcon is an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global family reunion for those already a part of our ecosystem, and a source of energy and creativity for all.

* _Devcon Bogota: https://devcon.org/en/_

**IV. ENS Integrations:**

1. ETH.LIMO has announced its V2, featuring faster load times, CCIP-Read for L2 and off-chain lookups, as well as resolving SkynetLabs content hashes.

Anyone with ENS Domains can simply amend .limo in their browser to resolve a personalized Nimi profile.
   * ETH.LIMO: https://eth.limo/

### 🖥️ [Protocol Development](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-dev/42)

**Gregskril.eth** has developed the ENS Fairy, the best way to gift ENS Domains to brands and public figures. Gifting an ENS name on http://ensfairy.xyz removes 3 transactions from the typical process, saving time and money.The ENS Fairy Vault is a multi-sig by Validator.eth & Nick.eth and is meant to keep the names of brands and public figures safe until they're ready for it.
