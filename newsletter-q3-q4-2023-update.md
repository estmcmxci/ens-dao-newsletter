### **Focus on Archival Content and Strategic Accessibility**

The ENS DAO Newsletter's primary focus for the allocated funding will be on **publishing and archiving content** for better accessibility. The project aims to create a comprehensive archive of past editions, making them easily searchable and accessible for the community. As part of this effort, the newsletter will be rethinking its accessibility initiatives, with translations being approached in a more strategic and high-impact manner, catering to the audience's demographics and reader demand.

To achieve this, the newsletter will temporarily pause the production of regular editorials and translations. Instead, the **editorial content will be considered on a case-by-case basis**, focusing on presenting more relevant, results-driven developments within ENS and the broader Ethereum Ecosystem.



### Publication Schedule

The ENS DAO Newsletter will now continue to be delivered bi-weekly, every Tuesday, at 11 AM Eastern Standard Time. This regularity will ensure consistent and timely updates for our community.
