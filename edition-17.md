#### **üåâ ETH San Francisco**

ETH San Francisco is a hackathon that enables teams to make something great in only 36 hours. The Web3 event brings together developers, industry experts, and companies from all around the globe and showcases the infrastructure and applications that will power the new decentralised web. ENS will have a presence at the event, with over $10,000 USD in prize money.

Alisha.eth: If anyone is hacking at ETHSanFrancisco, please jump into [this thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-hackathons-2022/14195/8) if you‚Äôre interested in building a team, or have spots on an existing team, and hopefully we can connect some people who are interested in building ENS project.

#### **üèõ State of ENS - Q3 2022**

Key Insights:

* Despite market weakness, ENS monthly active addresses remain robust. While down 33% from the May 2022 peak, monthly active addresses are still 2.5x higher year-over-year.
* ENS domain name registrations reached an all-time-high of 1.12 million in Q3 2022, up 71% quarter-over-quarter. Simultaneously, renewals grew 3x QoQ to over 100,000 in Q3 ‚Äô22.
* Revenue from ENS name registrations and renewals decreased 17% QoQ in USD terms (up 30% in ETH terms), due to a 27% decrease in registration revenue in USD terms.
* ENS treasury holds $185 million in unlocked funds and over $1 billion in locked tokens.

#### **üõ† ENSIP: Platform Source Parameter**

Originally proposed by Slobo.eth and advocated by Avsa.eth, the Platform Source Parameter is an ENS Improvement Proposal that encodes which website registered a .eth name; for example: how many registrations were done through ensfairy.xyz

"This proposal suggests a social convention that generates the secret from a combination of taking the first 6 characters of a namehash, add another 6 characters for extra data and combines it with the appropriate number of random bytes."

The ENS manager app(and other name registration apps), already generates this 'secret' parameter for the Step 1 commit transaction when registering a name. By utilizing the first 12 characters of the ‚Äòsecret‚Äô parameter, it would enable platforms to label and track analytics on registrations by leveraging the existing registrar contract.

This improvement would also facilitate identifying creators within the ENS Ecosystem that have provably demonstrated added value. It‚Äôs important to identify creators who develop the ecosystem. Retroactive funding works because you can detect what has already demonstrated value, instead of Stewards having to make bets on what they think could happen. The ENSIP would allow for visibility of high value-add ENS Ecosystem developers.

#### **üí∞ Grants Summary**

1. [**dWeb Services**](https://dwebservices.xyz/) is a pinning service for ENS+IPNS .eth websites. DWeb Services aims to support the .eth web community in updating and pinning their websites faster, and easier, with no gas costs. All of this is made possible with IPNS technology. It offers an easy-to-use UX, making it possible even for non-technical people to update their websites for free. For big projects like the ones mentioned above, dWeb Services provides an API tailored to the needs of the .eth web.
   * **Steward Commentary**: In consultation with .eth website subgroup, we have agreed on a grant of 5,000 USDC for dwebservices. This is becoming foundational infrastructure of the decentralized web with projects such as planetable.xyz, nimi.eth.limo, and predomain.eth.limo utilizing them. The grant is made to support dwebservices primary builder @tomlightning. Thank you for your continued efforts.
2. [**Planetable.xyz**](https://planetable.xyz/) is a native macOS app for building, browsing, and following dWeb content on IPFS + ENS. It‚Äôs a GUI consisting of a dWeb content reader, a two-column markdown editor, a static website generator, and a built-in IPFS node.
   * **Steward Commentary**: Stewards are currently considering grants for Planetable.xyz

_Update_: The meta-gov stewards have decided to extend the deadline for selecting a winner to the 18th of November, in order to give us more time to consult and negotiate with the authors of submissions. By the 18th we will select finalists and propose a DAO social vote on the shortlisted proposals for approval by the whole DAO.

**üèû ENS Agora**

The DAO Tooling pod is allocating funds to create an engaging and accessible delegation platform. The goal is to improve both the $ENS delegation experience and tools to help Delegates establish themselves in the role of a Delegate.

[Yiton Zhang is developing a delegation platform](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-agora-updates/14903) that puts decision making in the hands of qualified and engaged actors in the ecosystem. Their hypothesis is that focusing on making delegation low friction and transparency is one of the highest leverage things to invest in. Early mock up below.
