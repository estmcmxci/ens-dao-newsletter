### **üëã Hello!**

Welcome to the Ethereum Name Service DAO Newsletter! New publications are **released on the 1st and 15th of every month.**

Current outlets where it is available include the [ENS DAO Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/), through a dedicated [Substack](https://ensdaonews.substack.com/), and on the Newsletter's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ensdaonews), through Revue.

If you are new here, the [**Term 2 dashboard**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-term-2-dashboard/13788) is a great place to get started!

\--

**We Merged!** - Shortly before publication, [history was made](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) when Ethereum successfully transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus. This migration has been in development since the very first days of Ethereum, and represents the efforts of countless contributors working years on end. It isn't an exaggeration to say that this is one of the most significant moments in cryptocurrency history, and we are happy to have shared it with you.

**Huge thanks to our supporters on Gitcoin!** We are just past the halfway mark for Gitcoin Grants Round 15, and [the support from the community](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4861/ens-dao-newsletter) has been incredible! We are extremely grateful for the continued support and interest in our newsletter. Your contributions allow us to continue our operations and expand in new and exciting ways.
