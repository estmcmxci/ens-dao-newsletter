#### üåê DAO-wide Developments

**üó≥Ô∏è Recent Proposals**

**Note: There are no open proposals this news cycle.**

‚Äì

#### üíö Gitcoin Grants Round 15

The quarterly grants matching round has come to an end. The Public Goods Working Group contributed $50k in the main round, and another $50k in the advocacy round. The PG Working Group will continue to observe how funded projects have made an impact throughout the ENS DAO Ecosystem.

If you have submitted a project to GR15, please keep an eye out for an email from Gitcoin. Funding recipients verification may take up to 2 weeks. Matching funds will be distributed during the first half of October.

#### ü™ô Coinbase Integration

ENS.eth formally announced its partnership with ENS DAO Delegate, Coinbase (coinbase.eth). This partnership enhances the Protocol‚Äôs mission of global adoption by allowing anyone with Coinbase Wallet account to create a free-to-claim Web3 username. Existing ENS Names can connect to the integration as well to seamlessly transact and build out a Web3 digital identity.

#### üí∞ ENS Small Grants

Voting for the second round of ENS Small Grants has come to a close with over 30 projects in each round. Winning projects will receive a disbursement of 1 ETH. Please stay tuned to upcoming weekly Working Group calls for more information on when those funds will be disbursed.

We would like to thank all participants, grantees and voters. The ENS DAO Newsletter was voted among the top five Ecosystem grants and will receive a small grant of 1 ETH to fund our continued operations. Thank you so much!

#### üîÄ Name Wrapper Update

The much-anticipated Name Wrapper contract is now live on Goerli Test Network. The Name Wrapper is set to become a huge unlock for the greater ENS Ecosystem and will facilitate much more extensive building with ENS subdomains.

#### üá®üá¥ Devcon Bogot√°

ENS DAO will have a presence at this year‚Äôs [Devcon](https://devcon.org/) in Bogot√°, the city capital of Colombia. Attendants can receive custom ENS IYK cards which come with a POAP **(supplies are limited!)** . Pre-registration is required and you must pick up your card at the Devcon ENS Booth.

#### üåé ENS Global Learn Docs Translation

The Learn Docs intend to bring everything into a single repository that is able to expand as a knowledge base over time. They will go a long way in becoming the go-to resource for onboarding new users to ENS, troubleshooting, and building context around web3 and blockchain tech.

@Coltron.eth & estmcmxci.eth are hosting bi-weekly ENS Global calls to continue workshoping the translation initiative. We have onboarded the following contributors:

**Portuguese Team**

* leticiaferraz.eth
* oddfather.eth

**Spanish Team**

* estmcmxci.eth
* Fabio Anaya

We will be onboarding new contributors for **Hindi** and **Russian** soon. Our next Onboarding call will take place on October 19th.

#### üíø ENS DAO Music Web3 Playlists

estmcmxci.eth is currently seeking playlist curators for a community-led playlisting group. The playlists will be hosted on Ooh La La, a music web3 streaming aggregator. Slide into their dm on Telegram if you want to plug in.

### üìù Ecosystem Updates

Grants have been awarded to Ecosystem projects. These projects are built with the purpose of facilitating the sustainability and adoption of the ENS Protocol and its Ecosystem overall. Funding is dispersed from the Ecosystem Working Group after considerable deliberation from the Working Group Stewards.

#### Generic NFT Controller / Resolver by hodl.esf.eth

> The generic ENS mapper contract will allow NFT projects to easily allow their communities to claim subdomains that dynamically link to NFTs. This concept is based around a custom controller contract I wrote last year for Purrnelopes Country Club, this has over 800 subdomains currently registered.

A grant of 20,000 USDC and 250 $ENS has been approved for Generic NFT Controller/Resolver. This project is an excellent example of the type of project the ecosystem is proud to support. The project not only adds utility, but also broadens ENS‚Äôs reach. This is the first major project to utilize the name wrapper. The open source nature of the code will allow others to learn and expand its capabilities.

#### Optinames by stevegachau.eth

> Optinames are tradable and transferable sub-domains wrapped as ERC721s & fully integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). They can be resolved on L1 Ethereum by utilizing an off-chain resolver. Register a free ENS Subdomain on Optimism L2 and use it everywhere including L1 Ethereum.

A grant of 8,000 USDC has been approved for stevegachau.eth. Steve continues to build and improve the ecosystem. The projects outlined above are used daily by a variety of people across the ecosystem. We are happy to provide this grant retroactively for all that has been accomplished so far. We are looking forward to Steve‚Äôs future contributions.

#### Planetable.xyz

> Planet is a native macOS app for building and hosting decentralized websites on IPFS + ENS. You can use it to follow the updates from other ENS websites too. Content is hosted with a local IPFS node, so cloud is not required.

Stewards are currently considering providing a grant to this Ecosystem project.

#### üê£ ENS Endaoment

The Meta-Gov Stewards held a DAO-wide forum to discuss the ENS DAO‚Äôs endowment fund. The fund manager is responsible for ensuring the sustainability of protocol development indefinitely. The fund focuses on investing for the long-term, while minimizing the risk of substantial short-term losses.

Nick.eth originally proposed the idea on March 29, 2022, and later formally posted on the forum on August 18th, for DAO-wide consideration. Finally, on September 8th the RFP was put up for a Snapshot vote which successfully passed on the 13th.

The Meta-Governance Stewards are currently fielding proposals. The submission deadline is October 10th. You may submit your proposal by sending a direct message to any Meta-Governance Steward on the ENS DAO Forum.

#### üîÄ Name Wrapper

Jefflau.eth, Frontend & Solidity developer at True Names Limited announced the NameWrapper Goerli testnet launch on September 20th, 2022. The launch demonstrates a success for TNL, after over a year of research, two audits and multiple iterations on its smart contract architecture.

The NameWrapper infuses all ENS names with the ERC721 & ERC1155 token standards, provably trustless subdomain ownership, and the ability to relinquish control over subdomains which opens a wide range of trustless subdomain applications.

### üîí Security Tip

_Never download or run executable files because a stranger told you to._

A recent scam involves sending the victim a direct message on social media, claiming to offer payment for a ‚Äúreview‚Äù of an up-and-coming NFT game. The account and pages involved are typically very convincing. However, it is **never** advisable to download or run any unknown executable programs sent to you from strangers.

A malicious executable can take control of your entire system, and even do things like change your passwords without you knowing. If you are offered pay to mention or review of a product, the best thing to do would be to request a legally binding contract and have it reviewed by a legal professional before agreeing to anything.

And always remember to **never share your seedphrase** or end up in detention like Bart Simpson.
