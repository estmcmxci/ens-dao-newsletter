#### ‚öñÔ∏è [Meta-Governance](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/meta-governance/28)

**The Meta-Governance working group hosted three meetings since our last edition:**

* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting - Jan 17th, 2023 @ 7PM GMT](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/agenda-and-minutes-for-weekly-meta-gov-meeting-jan-17th-2023-7pm-gmt/15893)
* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting - Jan 24th, 2023 @ 7PM GMT](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-2pm-et-tuesday/15981/2?u=daylon.eth)
* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting - Jan 31th, 2023 @ 7PM GMT](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-2pm-et-tuesday/15981/4?u=daylon.eth)

\--

The current main focus of the Meta-Governance working group discussion is on two important proposals: [**Sell ETH into USDC**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-3-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906) and [**Endowment Initiation**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952).

[**Endowment Initiation**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952) (Karpatkey)

\[quote="karpatkey, post:1, topic:15952"] This proposal aims to initiate the Endowment by requesting the ENS DAO to transfer 10,766 ETH to a newly created SAFE provided by Karpatkey and owned by the DAO.

This transfer represents the first installment of a series of three equal monthly transfers until the Endowment reaches its full funding goal. \[/quote]

_For the latest on the endowment conversation, check out the discussion on the_ [**ENS DAO Forum**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952).

[**Sell ETH into USDC**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-3-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906)

\[quote="James, post:1, topic:15906"] This proposal executes a swap of 10,000 ETH into USDC, to ensure ENS DAO has enough to cover operating expenses for 18 - 24 months. \[/quote]

_The on-chain vote for this proposal is currently active on_ [**Tally**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/45461903078948131870051132081249892009497709518413744958551889217805827301425).

**Note:** Karpatkey is focused on managing the endowment fund (long-term) while the ETH sale provides a two-year runway for DAO operations (short-term). While these proposals have some similarities, they are separate discussions with different considerations, and will not affect one another.

#### üîÑ[ Ecosystem](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-ecosystem/32)

**The Ecosystem working group hosted two meetings since our last edition:**

* [Minutes for Weekly Ecosystem Meeting - Jan 19th, 2023 @ 5PM GMT](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/minutes-for-weekly-ecosystem-meeting-jan-19th-2023-5pm-gmt/15926)

**ENS Ecosystem Project Highlights**

* [**SetAvatar**](https://setavatar.eth.limo/) - A one screen application to help you set your PFP/avatar for your ENS domain, hosted on IPFS.
* [**eth.id**](https://eth.id/) - A site that allows users to create a single eth.id identity across their three main modes of communication - ENS name, email address, and web page.
* [**ENS Widget**](https://github.com/gskril/ens-widgets) - An open source widget that allows any react website to implement and register ENS names in a few flexible ways. It also allows tracking of who registered a name using your widget.
* [**Relay.cc**](https://relay.cc/) - Relay is a platform for connecting an ENS name with projects and company card on the site. The team is working on an OpenAI feature (currently in alpha) that allows users to chat with a bot trained on a project‚Äôs documentation.
* [**Org3**](https://twitter.com/ORG3\_ETH) - Org3 is an ENS subdomain based organization management tool. It provides visualization of the current subdomains of a parent name. It also has a file sharing system.
* [**ENS Doc**](https://ens-doc.vercel.app/sh36MOVrmE) - ENS Doc allows you to upload and share your file in a safe way. To use it, choose a file to upload and enter the ENS address you would like to share the file with. The site uploads the file to IPFS and creates a randomized file link to download the file that only the specified address will have access to.

_If you have a project that you would like to present during an ENS Ecosystem weekly call, please contact any of the Ecosystem stewards:_ [**slobo.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/slobo.eth) (lead steward), [**Limes**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/limes), and [**Yambo**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/yambo).
