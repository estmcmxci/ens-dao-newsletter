### üåÄ ENS Labs Updates

#### ENS Web Update: June 2023

ENS has been focusing on UX pattern modifications and bug fixes after the successful rollout of v3. They have revamped the primary name setting flow, allowing users to manage or own a name without an ETH record or resolver. The updated flow streamlines the process and optimizes transactions, reducing gas costs. Users now have the ability to unset their primary name directly within the app. The improvements were made based on valuable user feedback, demonstrating ENS's commitment to user needs. Additional enhancements include adding a primary name tag to profiles, showing if the resolver is from a wildcard lookup, and various bug fixes. ENS is also working on ensjs version 3, which has been refactored to use viem for a simplified codebase.
