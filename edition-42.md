**The Meta-Governance working group hosted its weekly meetings on August 22nd, 2023:**

* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting ‚Äî August 15th (cancelled)](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-11am-et-tuesday/15981/34?u=estmcmxci)
* [Minutes for Weekly Meta-Gov Meeting ‚Äî August 22nd](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-11am-et-tuesday/15981/36?u=estmcmxci)

‚Äî

#### Request for Feedback

The Meta-Governance stewards encourage the ENS community to participate in improving the Protocol by visiting ens.canny.io; it serves as a dedicated platform to collect user feedback, feature requests, integrations, and bug reports. The tool's upvoting feature, when widely utilized, can significantly boost community involvement and development. Members of ENS Labs and Working Group stewards have visibility over submissions, and will work to ensure the appropriate parties are notified of submissions. ‚Äî 08.03.23

‚Äî

#### Small Grants Update

The redesign of the Small Grants initiative is currently in progress, with the next round expected to kick off in the first week of September. The submission period will last approximately 10 days, followed by a 4-5 day window for voting. Instead of using POAP tokens, ERC1155 tokens will be used in the upcoming round.

To combat delegate fatigue and voter apathy, the frequency of the small grants period will be changed to every other month, beginning in September. ‚Äî 08.22.23

‚Äî

#### Endowment Review

@Karpatkey has shared [a review](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/karpatkey-h1-2023-review-for-the-ens-endowment/17682?u=estmcmxci) of the Endowment's progress since its initiation in March 2023, following the execution of EP 3.4: [Fund the Endowment (first tranche)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/90786656233306599444783442367171420493182391933134906270328139870999449830964). As of July 2023, the Endowment has $29.8M in non-custodial assets under management, 88.8% capital utilization, an APY of 3.37%, and monthly farming results of $82,265.

Pending approval, Karpatkey will initiate the Endowment's second tranche by proposing a new transfer of 16,000 ETH. For a in-depth review, see [Karpatkey H1 2023 Review for Endowment](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/karpatkey-h1-2023-review-for-the-ens-endowment/17682). ‚Äî 08.22.23

‚Äî

#### Validator Diversity

As mentioned in Karpatkey's review, part of the strategic plan focuses on diversifying the staked ETH and collaborating with new protocols to achieve long-term, low-risk growth. Active monitoring and research are underway to explore alternative investment options, and proposals that align with the company's risk appetite and overall objectives will be presented for consideration. ‚Äî 08.22.23

‚Äî

### ‚òÄÔ∏è [Public Goods](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/public-goods/37)

‚Äî

#### Public Goods Highlights: SheFi

SheFi, a recipient of a Large Grant from the Public Goods working group, aims to foster greater inclusivity in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector through its three pillars: **education, experimentation, and community**. The organization offers a 13-week comprehensive crypto education program and recently held SheFi Summit Paris 2023, an event featuring web3 activities and a successful collaboration with POAP. Their upcoming plans include hosting a mini SheFi summit at Devconnect and utilizing their grant funding to develop governance-related educational content.

Headed by [Maggie Love](https://twitter.com/maggielove\_), who places high value on diverse perspectives in governance, SheFi invites potential collaborators to reach out and explore opportunities for synergy. Watch the talks from their recent SheFi Summit on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8qnfdlcjL1iaplkPwZ22UtqbWI-gSKjC) to get further insights into their initiatives. ‚Äî 08.22.23

‚Äî

#### Bounty: Expanding Decentralized Identities

Sponsored by the Public Goods Working Group, this bounty aims to foster innovation in the way digital identities are stored, used, and interacted with on the blockchain. The challenge invites developers to submit projects that align with specified technical frameworks like ERC-3668: CCIP READ or ERC-4337 and other Account Abstraction primitives.

While the bounty is particularly interested in ideas that can integrate with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), it is open to any project that meets the criteria and resonates with the overarching ethos. To be considered, submissions must include a detailed project description with team member details, a link to the publicly visible source code, and a 2-3 minute demo video that offers a tangible illustration of how the implementation advances the field of decentralized identities. [Apply here](https://app.buidlbox.io/ftc/fund-public-goods/challenges/be8539b8-8693-4f9d-9577-96b448b9213a). ‚Äî 08.22.23

‚Äî

#### Funding Public Goods Discussion

The Working Group continues its discussion on maintaining a robust approach towards the funding of Public Goods projects ‚Äî with a focus on funding projects based on specific objectives and standards which may align thematically with Ethereum Improvement Proposals. The discussion is open and all are welcome to participate. ‚Äî 08.22.23

‚Äî

‚Äî

#### Update: Gasless DNSSEC

Gasless DNSSEC has been successfully deployed on the Sepolia test network, with contracts verified on Etherscan and current compatibility for .com and .xyz domains. The deployment can be viewed through a specific [GitHub PR](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/pull/274), and comprehensive documentation covering user flow, frontend guidelines, and other aspects will be available soon. While a minor gateway bug has been discovered, it doesn't necessitate a contract update. ‚Äî 08.24.23

‚Äî

#### Proposal: ENS on Swarm

Costanza Gallo & Viktor Toth from Swarm, a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, presented a technical overview of the technology. They are [proposing to move the ENS Registry data off-chain](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-on-swarm-decentralized-storage/17642) with the consideration of a bounty reward. Unlike ENS resolution (managed onchain), Swarm operates off-chain through a peer-to-peer network, facilitating reduced fees and enhanced scalability. ‚Äî 08.16.23

‚Äî

#### Grant: ETH.LIMO

[eth.limo](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/term-4-grants-summary/17624/3?u=estmcmxci) is a pioneering ENS gateway focused on privacy and enhanced user experience for accessing decentralized web (dWeb) applications and content. Designed to ensure strong privacy guarantees, eth.limo refrains from logging IP addresses and employs measures to block Google's FLoC algorithm, which otherwise tracks users' browsing activities.

The platform offers various features to enhance performance and reliability, such as support for .art domain name resolution, partnerships for IPFS pinning, and backend optimizations to reduce content caching time. With its latest updates, eth.limo has achieved significant growth, handling up to 1.5 million requests per hour‚Äîa staggering 1300% increase from the previous year. The platform's future plans include multi-region CDN deployment, IPFS clustering, and the development of ENS resolution and DNS resolver applications. ‚Äî 08.16.23

‚Äî

#### Grant: NameSys

[NameSys](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/term-4-grants-summary/17624/4?u=estmcmxci) is revolutionizing the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) landscape by offering a gasless, autonomous platform for storing ENS records off-chain. Utilizing a custom resolver called CCIP2 and integrating IPNS with CCIP-Read, the platform allows for free ENS record updates and dynamic avatars. This addresses the key challenge of high gas fees usually associated with on-chain updates. Security is front and center, as users can create IPNS keypairs securely without involving third-party services, ensuring data integrity. The platform also brings innovative features like dynamic avatars and programmable addresses and is developing additional functionalities such as private payments and dApp store redirects. NameSys is setting a new standard for secure, free, and dynamic ENS record management, making it accessible for enthusiasts at all levels. ‚Äî 08.28.23
