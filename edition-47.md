### 🌀 ENS Labs Updates

#### 📈 ENS Stats: October 2023

In [October 2023](https://x.com/ensdomains/status/1720132809338261879?s=20), ENS experienced significant growth; the service witnessed 56,000 new .eth domain registrations, bringing the total number of names to 2.4 million. This generated $1.2 million in protocol revenue, which was fully allocated to the ENS DAO. Additionally, the ENS ecosystem grew with 49,000 new Ethereum accounts that hold at least one ENS name, culminating in a total of 790,000 such accounts. The month also saw 47,000 primary ENS names being set, amounting to a cumulative total of 677,000. Furthermore, there was an increase in the personalization of ENS profiles with 11,600 new avatar records set, reaching a new high of 135,000 in total. — 11.02.23

### 🌐 Community Updates

#### ENS Small Grants Round: A Leap Forward in Community-Driven Innovation

The Small Grants round, which began on October 25th and concluded on October 31st, successfully attracted a diverse array of submissions aimed at enhancing the ENS ecosystem and supporting public goods within the Web3 space. The grants round saw a total distribution of 27 ETH, equivalent to roughly $50,000 USD, across 20 projects.

In an interesting development this year, the voting mechanism was overhauled from $ENS token-weighted voting to a one-person-one-vote system, facilitated by the issuance of a non-transferrable Working Group Grants Card. Between 300 and 600 of these cards were distributed to small grants participants, large delegates, active community members, and other stakeholders within the ENS community.

The top five projects in the ecosystem category, namely ENS Wayback Machine, 1W3, Namespace, NYCMobile.eth, and NameSys, shared a prize pool of 15 ETH, with awards ranging from 5 ETH to 0.7 ETH based on their ranking. The public goods category allocated a total of 13 ETH among its leading projects (Giveth, Ethereum News, dm3, Rotki, and Pairwise), also with a tiered prize structure. — 10.31.23

#### Ethereum Follow Protocol Garners Support

The Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP) has broadened its ecosystem, announcing a collaboration with @0xNimi and four additional launch partners: @skiffprivacy, @NamehashLabs, @Nifty\_Island, and @LlamaFolio. This protocol, aimed at enabling users to follow Ethereum accounts and manage lists of contacts within the network, is set to enhance the .eth profiles on @eth\_limo by displaying follower statistics. Designed to be simple and flexible, EFP intends to function as a foundational component in the Ethereum infrastructure, potentially as a transferable NFT for list portability.

#### Ethereum Evolutions, L2 Solutions

Vitalik.eth recently published a thought piece that delves into the dynamic landscape of Ethereum's layer 2 solutions. He highlights the rapid expansion of the layer 2 ecosystem, featuring projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, Kakarot, Taiko, Celo, Linea, and Zeth, among others. This evolution has led to increasing heterogeneity within the ecosystem, driven by a variety of factors, including the gradual transition of independent layer 1 projects toward closer integration with Ethereum, the quest for enhanced security by certain centralized projects, and the unique needs of non-financial applications like games and social media. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of user fee considerations in the decision-making process, and it provides insights into the trade-offs between rollups, validiums, and other systems. Trustlessly reading Ethereum and ensuring asset security remain central challenges in this evolving landscape, where adaptability and flexibility are key to future success. — 10.31.23

#### ENS DAO Financial Overview by avsa.eth

Avsa.eth's [reports](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/visualization-of-money-flows-between-dao-wallets/18010) that the ENS DAO has accrued close to $100 million, majorly from ETH/USDC transactions, with a steady income from the registrar controller amounting to roughly $30,000 daily. Expenditures amount to about $70 million, leaving $16 million in reserves, excluding ENS tokens. Significant payouts include contributions to Endaoment and a $11,500 daily allocation to ENS Labs, as per DAO proposals. Working groups' budgets are substantial, yet they maintain considerable unspent funds, with the Ecosystem group sitting on over $600,000. The report underscores the importance of robust auditing and transparent accounting for the DAO's funds, emphasizing the need for better tools to monitor spending and manage unspent funds effectively. — 10.24.23

#### Steward Compensation Framework

The Meta-Governance Working Group has developed a steward compensation structure. This new framework seeks to establish fair and transparent payment for stewards and lead stewards, addressing previous inconsistencies in compensation. A collective proposal mechanism dictates compensation norms, with no payment permitted outside of this structure.

The proposed compensation table recommends $3,000 monthly for each steward, totaling $18,000 per term, and $4,500 for leads, amounting to $13,500 per term. Additional discretionary funds are allotted based on the working group's majority decision. Secretaries are set to receive $5,500 monthly, while scribes receive $3,000. In total, the term compensation sums up to $294,000. The group suggests all stewards accept the stipend, retaining the option to redirect it, ensuring transparency and fairness moving forward. This structure will guide current and future compensation, without retroactive changes. — 11.02.23

#### Invalid Name Refund Proposal

Matoken.eth has issued an update on the Invalid Name Refund process. An error causing a negative refund amount was identified and corrected after a reassessment of the queries. The updated data shows changes in the number of refunds and the amounts, including six individuals who are no longer eligible for a refund and three new individuals who are. Five recipients' refunds differ by more than 0.01 ETH. A notable correction includes an address previously showing a negative refund, which will now receive 0.04748966914 ETH. The original query failed to consider the ETHRegistrarController4 and transactions within a specific date range, affecting the results. A comprehensive list of affected addresses with old and new total refunds has been provided, with significant differences highlighted. For those interested in transaction details, the updated full dataset is available for download, and queries can be run using tools like jq to examine specific addresses. The refund address list is now revised in the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10o38nCVabAD03Kw-F3vIdyBMQZPjUXEnXC3j\_jZD5jM/edit#gid=762892496). — 11.03.23
