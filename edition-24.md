### üìÉ ENS Support Docs

[**Cthulu.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/cthulu.eth/summary) has upgraded the ENS Documentation site, which is now live.

The Support Docs are designed to help answer common questions about ENS and also contains several guides and explainers.

_View it now at_ [**support.ens.domains**](https://support.ens.domains/docs).

### **üèõ Town Hall**

The Q4 Town Hall took place on Thursday, December 15th, 2022.

It featured updates from the ENS Labs team, ENS DAO Working Group stewards, presentations from several projects in the ecosystem, and more.

_Watch the full Q4 Town Hall_ [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtvZGkKiMic).

\--

A brief overview is provided below.

#### ENS Labs

**Front-end updates**

[**Khori.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/khori.eth/summary) kicked off the Town Hall with organizational updates from ENS Labs. This included the news that ENS has joined the [Blockchain Association](https://theblockchainassociation.org/) (Washington D.C.), information about the upcoming ENS V3 App launch and the _"Start Here"_ initiative.

The _Start Here_ initiative will focus on creating a simple, safe and secure means for new users to engage in Web3. The first step that anyone entering the Web3 space should take is securing an ENS name, but before that newcomers need to have a wallet. ENS Labs has been thinking about the user experience and what it will take to effectively onboard new users ‚Äî not only to ENS, but to Web3.

[**Jefflau.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/jefflau.eth/summary) continued the presentation by offering updates on the _Name Wrapper_, which is now being considered for a Q1 2023 release. The latest audit of bug mitigations is nearly complete and if there are no further concerns discovered, the core team would like to release the Name Wrapper on testnet in January for further analysis.

ENS Labs has also been considering ways to improve contract safety by utilizing [smart contract fuzzing](https://agroce.github.io/issta20.pdf) and [formal verification](https://media.consensys.net/how-formal-verification-can-ensure-flawless-smart-contracts-cbda8ad99bd1).

For the front end, the ENS Labs team has continued to develop and refine both the UI and UX for the new app ‚Äî check out [**alpha.ens.domains**](https://alpha.ens.domains) periodically the view the latest updates.

**Back-end updates**

[**Nick.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/nick.eth/summary) began his part of the Town Hall presentation by covering backend updates including contract upgrades, CCIP read, free subdomain issuance, and DNS-ENS integration.

The contract upgrades are meant to support Name Wrapper in addition to new features that are enabled by it. Moreover, registering new wrapped names will be cheaper than non-wrapped names. Gas savings are a key focus for the core team and contract upgrades will help lower the costs of name registrations, DNS integrations, and more.

New versions of the resolver and reverse registrar will also enable contracts to have the primary name set by the owner of the contract. This means that the owner of the smart contract will be able to set it rather than the contract itself, which will lead to more named contracts on Etherscan and elsewhere.

The updates will be bundled together and set for a DAO vote near the same time the Name Wrapper is deployed.

Development of CCIP-read continues, which enables off-chain resolution and makes it possible to use ENS without paying L1 fees. The core team is already working with several parties to produce production-ready integrations with Optimism, Arbitrum, ZKSync, and more. This will make it possible to spin up trustless gateways to L2s without having to rely on a centralized system.

CCIP-read will also make it possible to set up a DNS domain name in ENS without paying any gas fees at all.

#### ENS DAO Working Groups

**Ecosystem**

[**Slobo.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/slobo.eth/summary), lead steward of the ENS Ecosystem Working Group, kicked it off by highlighting builders across the ecosystem. The ENS DAO has granted approximately $150,000 in funding to builders like **premm.eth**, **frolic.eth** and **z80.eth**, who have all either helped support core protocol development or have developed innovative products that utilize ENS.

He also highlighted the ENS fellowship program, which awards one ENS scholar with **$50,000** to help them focus on ENS development. This term's scholar was [**gregskril.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/gregskril/summary) who has been a tremendous help to the DAO this year.

_Check out his portfolio_ [**here**](https://gregskril.com/).

**Public Goods**

[**Anthonyware.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/theanthonyware/summary), lead steward of the Public Goods Working group, followed up by highlighting the [Public Goods Scholarship](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/13) winners. Congrats to all the recipients of the inaugural scholarship stream, which is supported by [Superfluid](https://link3.to/superfluidhq) ‚Äî an asset streaming protocol that brings subscriptions, salaries, and rewards to DAOs and crypto-native businesses.

**Meta-Governance**

Finally, [**Coltron.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/coltron.eth/summary), lead steward of the Meta-Governance Working Group, wrapped up the ENS DAO updates. Throughout Q4, the DAO issued approximately **$582,000** USDC across all Working Groups to support hackathons, Devcon, ETHIndia, ETHSanFrancisco, ENS Grants, and builder support.

There were more active participants in DAO-wide voting since the inception of the DAO, and a focus has been placed on supporting gas free re-delegation near the end of this term. DAO tooling was a focus of the Meta-Gov Working Group this term, and as such, a tool was developed for just that.

The tool, [**ENS Agora**](https://agora.ensdao.org/) was built as a one-stop for ENS voting and delegation. It features delegate profiles, including the number of proposals voted on, voting power, number of accounts delegating, and more.

Lastly, it was mentioned that Karpartkey, the chosen ENS DAO Endowment fund manager, will publish a proposal to fund the endowment on the ENS Forum.

_You can read Karpartkey's proposal_ [**here**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-endowment-initial-conditions-required-steps/15684).

* [Phi](https://philand.xyz/)
* [dm3](https://dm3.network/)
* [.ART](http://protocol.art/)
