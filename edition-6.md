### üì∞ Working Group News

If you would like to contribute to ENS DAO, [please contact a Steward.](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/q1-q2-2022-steward-announcement)

#### üë•[ Community](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/community/12)

**Onboarding**

* @vegayp Set up the Community Stewards in Zenhub during the last Steward Call.
* Weekly Onboarding continues to happen every Friday at 1:30 EST (6:30pm UTC), hosted by **vegayp** and @coltron.eth. The meeting is a one-hour open conversation about the ENS DAO. Join via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/gvg-bkdk-xaa).

**IRL \[In Real Life] Events**

* The IRL Events Subgroup is planning to have a small amount of [swag](https://www.figma.com/file/Q24oni7iseyBm6qKc3F7hT/ENS-DAO-Shirts?node-id=0%3A1) and POAPs, and is looking to host a meet-up at [ETHNewYork](https://nyc.ethglobal.co/).
* @Limes and **coltron.eth** are handling the swag. A small run of shirts are in production and a POAP bounty is currently underway until May 19th on the [POAPathon Discord](https://discord.gg/sTre4Qcb).
* This POAP will be given out to anyone interacting with the ENS DAO in ETHNewYork. It will be delivered via QR and NFC by the ENS DAO Community Stewards.

**Communications Subgroup**

**May 18**

* 5pm EST (9pm UTC) **coltron.eth** will be hosting a Discord Stage in the [ENS Discord](https://chat.ens.domains/) with **n0vax.eth** from the [10k Club](https://twitter.com/10kClubOfficial). The purpose of this stage will be to chat about the ENS DAO and provide an open forum for the 10k Club to discuss how we can align interests.
* 12pm EST (4pm UTC) **estmcmxci** will host the first ENS DAO LatAm space with contributors **futurx\_** & **cordobes.eth** to discuss how to contribute to the DAO.

**Contributor Spotlight**

@estmcmxci will begin a [Contributor Spotlight](https://hackmd.io/@estmcmxci/BJ4XdRFHq) of each steward in the ENS DAO to talk about how work gets done. The spotlight will consist of the following:

```
- Steward Profile 
- Roles and responsibilities of a steward
- Vision for ENS and how contributors can get involved
```

**Translation Subgroup**

* **coltron.eth** is looking to move away from Gitbook as this platform will not allow us to scale translations as needed. He has [identified](https://github.com/coltron-code/i18n-test) that a doc library built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) and Crowdin will meet our needs.
* He will meet with **Makoto** to discuss the next steps and will start working to migrate our content library in the next two weeks.
* **estmcmxci** will be in touch with a new Russian speaking contributor to the Translation Initiative.

**Code of Conduct**

* The Stewards (**coltron.eth** and @spencecoin) and Lead Coordinator **estmcmxci** met with Meta-Governance Steward, @simona\_pop.
* **simona\_pop** will add edits to Code of Conduct Draft and review.
* Simona would like **estmcmxci** to take a coordinator role in the Meta-Gov group and has spoken to @James & @alisha.eth about it.
* CoC has been transferred to the Meta-Gov working group - **estmcmxci** will follow up.

### üîí Security Tip

**Never sign a crypto wallet transaction without being certain of what you are signing.** [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) is currently the most common method attackers are using to gain access to a victim's wallet. If you don't know what your wallet is asking you to agree to and why, _close the window!_
