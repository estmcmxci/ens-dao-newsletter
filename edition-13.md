### **👋 Hello!**

Hello and welcome to the Ethereum Name Service DAO Newsletter!

New publications are **released on the 1st and 15th of every month.**

Current outlets where it is available include the [ENS DAO Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/), through a dedicated [Substack](https://ensdaonews.substack.com/), and on the Newsletter's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ensdaonews), through Revue.

If you are new here, the [**Term 2 dashboard**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-term-2-dashboard/13788) is a great place to get started!

### 📝 Ecosystem Updates

#### [ENS Ecosystem Fellowship](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-ecosystem-fellowship/14133)

This term, the Ecosystem WG is running an experiment called the **ENS Ecosystem Fellowship.**

The purpose of the Fellowship program is to identify and support builders/developers who are actively creating and contributing within the ENS ecosystem, or have already made a significant impact in their contributions to ENS.

Fellows are selected based on their potential to make positive, long-lasting contributions to the ENS Ecosystem.

Each fellow will receive a grant to the value of US$50k for the Term, to encourage them to continue their work building and experimenting with ENS and to acknowledge their past impact on the ENS ecosystem.

The ENS Ecosystem Fellow for the second term of 2022 will be [**@gregskril.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/gregskril/summary)

Greg has been contributing to the ENS ecosystem since December 2021. For a review of his contributions, check the [forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-ecosystem-fellowship/14133).

#### [Community Manager @ TNL](https://ens.domains/jobs)

ENS DAO is hiring a community manager. If you or someone you know would like to apply, please message **@alisha.eth**.

#### [eth.link Down](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO/status/1562998396968873984?s=20\&t=uqe3QnNlBwF2WpddtbDEMQ)

Previously, adding ".link" to the end of an ENS name would act as a gateway, allowing for an ENS domain to be resolved in a normal web browser. However, due to the eth.link domain name expiring, **the eth.link service is down for the foreseeable future.** Possibly for good, if the domain is acquired by an outside party.

We’re trying to support the parties involved to get it back up and running again. Until further notice, we strongly recommend using a different gateway service - **eth.limo** is a great alternative. If you would like to support their work, please consider [**donating to eth.limo through Gitcoin**](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4760/ethlimo-your-privacy-focused-ens-ipfs-gateway).

Alternatively, we've set up another alternative gateway on http://eth.domains, meaning you can add either '.domains' or '.limo' to your ENS name to reach it via standard web browser.

#### [2 Million .eth Names Registered](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO/status/1559996530345402375)

On August 17th, 2022, ENS celebrated a new milestone - crossing over 2 million domain registrations since its inception five years ago.

#### [Huobi Global](https://www.huobi.com/)

Over the last month we’ve worked with Huobi Global on integrating ENS names. This integration went live on Wednesday. The millions of Huobi users around the world are now able to send and receive using their ENS domains. Huobi is a great partner to work with.

#### [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

Coinbase [has integrated support](https://twitter.com/brian\_armstrong/status/1561935998577102850) for decentralized identities, powered by ENS. You can claim \[your name].cb.id for free with Coinbase Wallet.

More details will be provided when dates for the spaces have been selected. @elle97 will lead the initiative alongside estmcmxci.eth.

He will take more of a curatorial approach for PG outreach to LatAm communities, as there seems to be a great amount of content being generated already.

### 💰 [Term 2 Grants Summary](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/term-2-grants-summary/14115)

#### Nimi

[Nimi.eth](http://nimi.eth.limo/) started as a hackathon project at ETH Amsterdam 2022.

**Project Lead:** The basic idea behind Nimi was to make it easier for users to host content on their ENS domain. Currently Nimi could be thought of as a “Linktree for web3." But that’s just the beginning. We want to act as your web3 connector, aggregating all your favourite parts of web3 and hosting them on your ENS domain.

**Steward Commentary:** A grant of 15,000 USDC + 100 ENS has been approved, with the payment split into two parts. After conversations with **@neiman** of the .eth Websites Subgroup, we determined that the first payment will amount to 8,000 USDC + 100 ENS. The remaining 7,000 USDC will be distributed at the discretion of the Ecosystem stewards, with the intention of the remainder being distributed after a midterm update.

#### ENS Academy

**Project Lead:** ENS Academy aims to accelerate the adoption of ENS worldwide. We bring ENS experts and web3 entrepreneurs to share their knowledge with the global community. Our goal is to educate, support, and empower anyone who can benefit from this technology. We built a platform where we can all learn the fundamentals, skills, and possibilities of ENS. We currently provide focused interviews in the form of Twitter spaces/podcasts and educational content through our ENSA forum, which adds value to the community.

**Steward Commentary:** A grant of 20,000 USDC + 100 ENS has been approved, with the payment split into two parts. The first payment will amount to 8,000 USDC + 100 ENS. The remaining 12,000 USDC will be distributed at the discretion of the Ecosystem stewards, with the intention of the remainder being distributed after a midterm update. ENS Academy multi channel (forum, twitter, podcasts) content is a boon to the ecosystem. The content educates existing members and helps to onboard new ones. We are happy to support this effort.

### 🖥️ [Protocol Development](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-dev/42)

#### [Name Wrapper](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/mid-quarter-update/14162)

We’re almost there! We have conducted an audit through Code4rena and are in the process of responding to the findings. We expect completion by the end of this quarter (Sept 30).

### 🔒 Security Tip

**Beware of imposters!** Currently, crypto related [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) attempts are rampant across social networking sites, including Discord, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and even LinkedIn.

Thieves prey upon the trust of unsuspecting victims to steal their crypto by posing as trustworthy accounts, or by deploying fake websites that appear nearly identical to the real thing. While steps are taken to report and take down these fake accounts and websites, it is a never-ending game of cat and mouse, as new fake accounts are constantly being made to take the place of any that are taken down.

An example of a **FAKE** ENS Twitter phishing account can be seen [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/IjaaZe6.png).

As you can see, these fake accounts can be very convincing upon first glance. You can also see just how effective this type of scam can be, judging by the amount of engagement they are able to achieve.

* Always practice skepticism when logging in to your crypto wallet to ensure you are using the real website or application.
* Never sign any wallet message that you do not recognize or approve any transaction message that you did not initiate yourself.
