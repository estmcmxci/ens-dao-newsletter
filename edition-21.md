#### 🖥️ ENS Core Updates

**New Integrations:**

* The [AlchemyPay](https://twitter.com/AlchemyPay) Ramp Solution now supports the distributed and open naming system ensdomains. You can now enter your #ENS name when buying crypto. Purchased crypto is sent to your domain name mapped wallet address.
* Web3 Developer Platform, [Alchemy](https://twitter.com/AlchemyPlatform), now features Automatic ENS Name resolution for all externally owned address queries.

\--

**Name Wrapper:**

* Updates are provided weekly by an ENS Labs team member. This week’s updates were provided by [Makoto](https://twitter.com/makoto\_inoue) and [Jeff Lau](https://twitter.com/\_jefflau).
* New documentation have been made available to the public which features technical aspects of the Name Wrapper feature plus use-case examples. View them [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/wrapper/README.md)
* Code audit for the Name Wrapper is currently underway and the rough timeline for release is January.
* For an indepth explanation on the Name Wrapper, view Jeff's explanation from last month's [ENS Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPSvO5PV5Is\&t=1134s)

**Ethereum Name Services Improvement Proposal (ENSIP):**

Xomia.eth and BambooJuice.eth of [Kola Labs](https://twitter.com/KolaMetaverse) have put forth a new ENSIP that features a process for retrieving audio media associated with an ENS domain.

Overview:

* Static PFP is insufficient for the personal and iterative web3 life. We are seeing a growing demand of multimedia formats such as music, audio and video because they are more dynamic and expressive. We call it Multimedia Identity (MI) . One can associate one or more MIs with an existing ENS domain, and play the audio or video inside metaverse or social platforms interoperably. This proposal will focus on audio.
