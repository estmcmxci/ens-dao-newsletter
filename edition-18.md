**üê£ ENS Endaoment Update**

After speaking to references and existing customers, and following internal discussion, the stewards have eliminated the following proposals from consideration as finalists:

* Metix
* Llama
* Fyde
* Mimic

We are still considering the following proposals as potential finalists, and are in discussions with their teams:

* Avantgarde
* Karpatkey
* AdamDAO

The finalists will go to a vote on the 18th. The stewards agreed upon this timeline shift to allow more time to gain feedback from references on the current submissions.

Boardroom, a Web3 Governance Manager, shared a detailed article reviewing the ENS Endaoment initiative which goes in depth into the DAO's screening process for a fund manager:

> üìù Boardroom Brief 06[@ENS\_DAO](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is actively searching for a fund manager to help steward the protocol's upcoming endowment. The web3 naming service hopes this new initiative brings stability and longevity to the protocol.\
