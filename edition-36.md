Steward Elections for Term 2 of 2023 will begin at 9am UTC on June 10.

There will be a three day nomination window, followed by a five day election window.

‚Äî

**Endowment Updates**

* A proposal to whitelist a bundle of items related to the endowment.ens.eth wallet has been reviewed and will be posted to the forum soon. An executable vote on Tally will follow and, if passed, the proposal will be deployed and executed.
* Aura have a planned migration that will affect the pool used by the endowment. While it is a simple migration, it requires updating presets and prompts two community votes.
* To avoid doubling efforts, @Karpatkey will wait two weeks to combine several proposed changes into a single community vote.
* Any change is a joint exercise, with proposed changes to strategy being initiated by either karpatkey or from the DAO community. Karpatkey remains focused on the long term vision of the endowment and continues to monitor market conditions, new trends, etc.



‚≠ê _Weekly endowment reports are shared in_ [_**this forum thread**_](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665)_, where you can also engage and discuss the endowment with the karpatkey team_



**Additional Topics**

**Aragon DAO Global Hackathon 2023**

* ENSify won $2,500 for the 'Kind Reminder' bounty.

> "Kind Reminder Bounty: Notifying interested parties about governance proposals or working group meetings can be a tedious task. With the governance community spread across Twitter, email, and Telegram it would be great to give people the option to get reminders where they prefer. Not everyone hangs out in governance forums to stay up to date with notifications"

* @alisha.eth will look to implement ENSify with @gregskril over the next few weeks.

**Refunding Gas for Delegations & Governance**

* The Meta-Gov working group will be reimbursing gas costs for governance proposals dating back to the beginning of the DAO.
* This includes any on-chain executable proposal where delegates paid gas to vote.
* [ethback.xyz](https://ethback.xyz/), a tool created by @gregskril, will be used to distribute the reimbursements.
* The Meta-Gov working group will continue providing gas-less delegation for another month on [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens) for anyone holding 10 or more $ENS tokens.
* Gas-less re-delegation also continues on [delegate.ens.domains](https://delegate.ens.domains/) for holders of 50 or more tokens.

This ENS-focused round provided an effective way for the community to support projects building on top of ENS by utilizing Gitcoin's [**quadratic funding**](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program-1/general-questions/whats-quadratic-funding) model, which calculates the proportion of match funding a grantee is eligible to receive based on the _breadth of contributors_, rather than the _depth of contributions._

‚≠ê **ENS DAO Newsletter** received support from the _second-most_ unique contributors in the round, granting the _maximum funding allowed_ from the matching pool. As always, we are incredibly thankful for our generous readers and supporters!
