#### 📈 ENS Stats: October 2023

In [October 2023](https://x.com/ensdomains/status/1720132809338261879?s=20), ENS experienced significant growth; the service witnessed 56,000 new .eth domain registrations, bringing the total number of names to 2.4 million. This generated $1.2 million in protocol revenue, which was fully allocated to the ENS DAO. Additionally, the ENS ecosystem grew with 49,000 new Ethereum accounts that hold at least one ENS name, culminating in a total of 790,000 such accounts. The month also saw 47,000 primary ENS names being set, amounting to a cumulative total of 677,000. Furthermore, there was an increase in the personalization of ENS profiles with 11,600 new avatar records set, reaching a new high of 135,000 in total. — 11.02.23

#### Debate: Patents in Open-source Ecosystems

In a nuanced situation, Unstoppable Domains (UD) has made strategic moves that have stirred the waters with ENS Labs. UD, having secured a patent and actively pursuing others, positions itself protectively within the Web3 domain. They have extended an invitation to ENS Labs to join the Web3 Domain Alliance, an initiative led by UD, which ostensibly champions open innovation.

Nick Johnson of ENS Labs has publicly expressed concern about this direction. ENS, a proponent of open-source and open standards, seems to feel that UD’s actions could potentially stifle innovation in the Web3 naming space. There is an implication that ENS Labs sees the requirement to join the Web3 Domain Alliance as a form of strong-arming, given UD's patent activities.

ENS has suggested an alternative: a legally enforceable patent pledge from UD to the entire Web3 community, ensuring open-source access and preventing potential litigation against innovators in the space. However, UD’s response indicates a belief in the protective power of patents and a preference for managing these issues within the alliance framework they lead.

The discourse suggests a tension between two philosophies: one that believes in an unencumbered commons for innovation and another that sees strategic patenting and alliances as necessary for defending against threats, particularly from Web2 incumbents. ENS Labs stands firm in its position, willing to challenge the patent if they believe it encroaches upon their innovations. Meanwhile, UD holds that their approach with the alliance and patenting is in the best interest of Web3’s future, implying that their methods provide a safeguard for the community.

Both parties appear to remain open to dialogue, although their stances on how best to foster innovation within Web3 are at odds. The resolution of this conflict could set a precedent for how intellectual property is handled in the emergent and rapidly evolving Web3 space. — 11.16.23

#### **EVM Gateway | Scaling ENS on L2**

ENS Labs has [unveiled the EVM Gateway](https://x.com/ensdomains/status/1724851193703542817?s=20); it is designed to enhance interoperability across Ethereum Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, paving the way for a new era of seamless blockchain integration. By facilitating secure and efficient cross-chain interactions, the EVM Gateway serves as a cornerstone for the next generation of Layer 2 resolvers. Its modular architecture empowers developers to either set up their own gateways or leverage existing ones, ensuring a versatile and user-friendly experience. Already making waves, the EVM Gateway has been adopted for early use on the Optimism Goerli Testnet, marking a significant milestone in ENS Labs' Layer 2 [roadmap](https://ens.domains/roadmap/). With the potential to revolutionize communication between smart contracts and decentralized applications, the EVM Gateway is poised to foster a more connected and efficient ecosystem. — 11.15.23

#### **Constellation Connect | Keynote**: The EVM Gateway

At Chainlink's Constellation Connect in London, Matoken.eth delivered a presentation on the EVM CCIP-Read Gateway. This event marked the first public unveiling of this scaling technology developed by ENS Labs. The presentation covered various aspects, including ENS's offchain strategy, the intricacies of the EVM L2 Gateway, and its applications beyond ENS. Matoken.eth also introduced practical components like the [Offchain Resolver Starter Kit](https://offchain.ens.gregskril.com) and the [EVM Gateway Starter Kit](https://evmgateway-starter.vercel.app/). Review the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aaYLMlxj\_lDuLjHeG5TVpdS2EKnTOxnJo9QH-J1-mro/edit#slide=id.g297fdf11f20\_0\_579) and visit the [repository](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway). — 11.08.23

#### **Devconnect | Keynote**: The ENS Canon

At Devconnect, @matoken.eth and tanrikulu.eth (@mdt) [presented a comprehensive overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DoAwsLjJY3dsHvcXzpE\_E1Quj55FvmkOVdOGCWnNECc/edit#slide=id.g15a0a492d67\_0\_865) of "The ENS Canon." This presentation explored the intricacies of ENS and its multifaceted utilities in Web3. Key highlights of the presentation included an in-depth explanation of what ENS is, its integration examples, and its role as a Web3 username. The speakers delved into three levels of building on ENS: reading ENS data, writing ENS data, and utilizing the EVM Gateway. They demonstrated the practical use of ENS in various scenarios, such as reverse lookups and avatar text record examples. The discussion also touched upon advanced concepts like the EVM Gateway's role in verifying Layer 2 data on Layer 1, emphasizing its importance in a trust-minimized gateway. This presentation not only informed the audience about the technical aspects of ENS but also highlighted its significance in improving user experience in the Web3 ecosystem. — 11.17.23

#### DAO Financial Report

The ENS DAO October Financials reveal a strong position in terms of sustainability and endowment. Revenues are higher than cash burn, with a cash inflow of $1.2 million, which is 2.17 times the cash burn rate, and an operating runway of 151 months. This indicates a healthy financial status, with the current revenues at $1.8 million compared to $1.9 million in the previous month and $2.8 million in the previous year. The normalized cash burn stands at $0.6 million, consistent with the previous month and down from $0.8 million the previous year. Reserves have increased to $85 million, up from $80 million last month and $62 million last year, consisting of $59 million in ETH and $26 million in USDC​​.

The endowment is also well-funded, with the second tranche completed and a social consensus reached to reduce stETH exposure to 20%. The endowment's assets amount to $58.8 million, with $13.0 million in stablecoins and $45.8 million in ETH invested. The Profit and Loss (P\&L) for the period stands at $4.3 million, which includes $4.2 million from ETH mark-to-market and $117k from returns. These returns count token yield farming rewards when they are claimed and converted to the base currency. The financial reporting indicates that the endowment's recurring revenues cover 21% of the cash burn, which is a positive sign of financial health and forward planning.​ — 11.09.23

The discussion consisted of increasing accessibility of engaging in DAO proposals. Coltron.eth expressed a keen interest in fostering discussions on this matter.

Coltron recommended setting aside this topic for a future meta-governance discussion. Additionally, it was announced that a DAO Town Hall is scheduled for December, with the exact date yet to be confirmed. — 11.07.23

#### Project Presentation: eth.cd

Hidayath.eth recently presented their project, eth.cd, during the ecosystem working group call. Their initiative revolves around creating a social network centered around ENS domains, aiming to assign a "Social Score" based on the number of ENS records associated with users. In the future, they plan to expand this score to encompass other protocols as well. With approximately 70,000 unique names complete with avatars, they intend to display the top 100 names on the platform's homepage. Additionally, they are actively working on establishing standards for ENS records, such as integrating Instagram links. Hidayath.eth's vision extends to integrating various social and social graph tools into their protocol, including the Ethereum Follow Protocol. — 11.09.23
