### üåÄ ENS Labs Updates

#### ENS Labs Pioneers Multichain Data Retrieval with `evmgateway`

ENS Labs is working to improve interactions between Ethereum's L1 and L2 chains with their `evmgateway` project, suggesting that it might shape future L2 resolvers. It is designed to retrieve data proofs from different EVM chains. Although promising, it's still under development and not ready for mass use. They've achieved progress with Optimism, an L2 solution. These efforts by ENS Labs indicate the industry's aim to enhance cross-chain operations. The `evmgateway` can be found on the ENS Labs [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway). The repository reveals that it implements a generic CCIP-Read gateway. The primary purpose of this gateway is to fetch state proofs of data from other EVM chains, particularly enabling L1 contracts to retrieve and verify data from L2 contracts within a read context. ‚Äî 10.16.23

#### Onyx (J.P. Morgan) Explores Web3 and Digital Identity with ENS

[Onyx by J.P. Morgan recently delved into the realm of Web3](https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/documents/Digital-identity-assessing-web3s-building-blocks.pdf), emphasizing the significance of digital identity (DI); it refers to the online portrayal and recognition of any individual or organization. At present, centralized DI data presents challenges, mainly: **(data) does not truly belong to the individual it signifies, paving the way for fraud and limiting self-expression.** To tackle this, Onyx discussed the quartet of components that construct the Web3 DI framework: _Identifiers, Identity attributes, Reputation, and Digital collectables and assets._

**ENS is recognized by Onyx as a quintessential component of this framework**, allowing users to have unique names tied to their blockchain addresses, reducing reliance on centralized systems. Global institutions acknowledge the essential role of DID technology, such as ENS, in promoting decentralized identity management for the Web3 era. For more on this perspective, Onyx's comprehensive document can be accessed [here](https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/documents/Digital-identity-assessing-web3s-building-blocks.pdf); alternatively, review [Namespace](https://linktr.ee/namespace.eth) founder and ENS Delegate, @cap breakdown the article on [X](https://x.com/TheCapHimself/status/1713900758649942303?s=20). ‚Äî 10.20.23

#### "AI Generates, Crypto Authenticates": ENS Utility in Authenticating Generative AI

At SmartCon2023 held earlier this month, [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis) discussed the utility of ENS and IPFS in AI content authentication. The main idea is straightforward. Existing content can be mapped to a specific content-hash and then linked to an ENS name. This mechanism allows for easy verification of content's origins‚Äîdistinguishing whether it was generated by AI or a human. While the potential of Generative AI grows, ENS and IPFS will continue to offer a reliable method for authentication. Balaji's presentation can be accessed in full [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0C52YdH62s). Further details about SmartCon are available on their [official website](https://smartcon.chain.link/home). ‚Äî 10.21.23

#### ENS Name Ownership Display and Management: User-Centric Updates

The [ENS App](https://ens.app) received a significant update in how name ownership is displayed and managed. The revamped solutions were devised after rigorous testing in collaboration with the community. ‚Äî 10.18.23

1. Introducing a dedicated 'Ownership' tab:
   * This new tab clarifies name ownership as the specific addresses associated with a name. This approach comes after insights gathered from user research which indicates that most users are primarily concerned with understanding who has the power to alter their names. The updated display showcases all addresses with any ownership over a name, organizing them by address rather than function.
2. Role management and permissions:
   * The new update introduces a more streamlined process for modifying permissions. The 'Send' functionality has been revamped to align more with its label. Now, users can transmit all editable roles to a different address and even opt to erase the profile data. This adjustment simplifies the process of bestowing names to acquaintances.
3. Introducing 'Sync manager':
   * The 'Sync manager' allows owners to easily set themselves as the Manager, which is especially beneficial when acquiring names from secondary markets. Users will also observe the incorporation of [indigo helpers](https://x.com/ensdomains/status/1714651457771986987?s=20), a new design pattern vital to the manager app.

#### ENS Channel Launches on Farcaster

ENS has inaugurated a new channel on the decentralized social network, Farcaster. Those interested in ENS can follow this channel for updates and interactions. A recent AMA session hosted by Gregskril.eth, Developer Relations at ENS, is accessible via [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/greg/0x28ee4d35). Additionally, they developed a platform for easily gifting Farcaster accounts. The procedure involves a friend signing a message to receive a URL, another party visiting said URL for payment, and then the friend can use any desired client. The platform can be explored [here](https://gift.fcstr.xyz/). ‚Äî 10.17.23

#### Worldbuilding on Decentraland with ENS

[Decentraland](https://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1712100834274599207?s=20) has introduced DCL Worlds accessibility for ENS domains. Beyond Genesis City, these personal 3D spaces can be accessed using either a Decentraland NAME or an ENS domain. Those with an ENS domain can obtain a Decentraland World with a fixed scene file size limit of 25 Mb. Designed for newcomers, these Worlds act as an entry point into the Decentraland ecosystem. During deployment from the Builder, users can opt for a Decentraland NAME or an ENS Domain from their wallet. Once a scene is uploaded, it can be accessed through the Decentraland Explorer using the specified NAME. In essence, ENS domains provide an alternative method to access, acquire, and manage Decentraland Worlds. Start worldbuilding [today](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/worlds/about/). ‚Äî 10.11.23

#### ENS to discuss CCIP-read at Ethereum Block Summit

The Ethereum Block Summit has announced a new addition to its roster of speakers - @mdt. Among the topics of focus this year is the unveiling of [EIP-3668: Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668). This groundbreaking standard has been meticulously developed by ENS founder, Nick Johnson. One of the core features of this protocol, CCIP-Read, promises to significantly enhance the capabilities of smart contracts. It is particularly designed to empower offchain and Layer 2 data, ensuring that smart contracts can seamlessly tap into these critical data streams.

#### Integrating ENS: Enhanced User Experiences in Mailchain and Coinbase Wallet

In recent ecosystem developments, service providers are increasingly leveraging the capabilities of ENS to enhance user experience. [Mailchain](https://twitter.com/Mailchain\_xyz/status/1714265449205272988?s=200), a prominent web3 email service provider, has taken a significant step forward by integrating ENS. Users of the Mailchain platform will now see ENS names prominently displayed in both the 'to' and 'from' sections within their app, streamlining the email experience by associating Ethereum addresses with easily recognizable names. In parallel, [Coinbase Wallet has made advancements](https://x.com/sadaf\_eth/status/1714695352274874764?s=20) in its cross-messaging transaction protocol (XMTP) functionality. With their recent update, users can now utilize ENS names to seamlessly send and receive funds directly through direct messages, completing transactions in mere seconds. This not only simplifies the transaction process but also elevates the role of human-readable addresses in daily crypto interactions. ‚Äî 10.18.23

#### Enhanced FriendTech Address Resolution: .frenzens.eth

[0xflick](https://warpcast.com/flick/0xe607e1d9) introduced .frenzens.eth domain; it allows for the resolution of any Friendtech address using associated X handles and ENS subnames. For instance, to fetch any Friendtech address, one could utilize the ENS: 0xflick.frenzens.eth, as long as a valid X handle is registered on Friendtech. The mechanism behind this functionality involves a blend of CCIP offchain reads and a tailored ENS resolver. When a query for frenzens.eth is initiated, an onchain lookup is triggered, which then reverts with a pointer to a REST endpoint. Subsequently, this endpoint engages with the Friendtech API to retrieve the address and avatar, responding with a signed payload. ENS clients proceed to authenticate this payload onchain, ensuring its validity and origin from a reputable source before returning the resultant data. This system facilitates transparent offchain lookups for ENS sub-domains, bridging a significant functional enhancement to the existing infrastructure.

#### Updates on Gasless DNSSEC Implementations

In recent developments within the DNSSEC sphere, there's been significant excitement surrounding gasless implementations. On October 13th, in a response to an inquiry made by @clowestab, gregskril.eth confirmed that the DNSSEC Oracle Gateway is indeed open source. Previously, DNSSEC, which ensures users access the correct websites, required computational resources that resulted in gas fees. This new gateway reduces those costs and it's open source. The advancement promises enhanced security and more affordable internet domain resolutions for everyone. For those interested in diving deep into its source code or contributing to its development, the DNSSEC Oracle Gateway can be accessed at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ensdomains/ccip-read-dns-gateway/). ‚Äî 10.13.23

#### Project Highlights

**1. Fluidkey | Antonio Seveso:** Fluidkey is the winner of the overall ENS prize at ETH Rome. It allows users to generate an infinite number of stealth addresses when resolving ENS names. Addresses are controlled by the same key pair and appear together in FluidKeys UI. The project is in Alpha; sign up for updates on fluidkey.com.

**2. 1W3 | @hidayath.eth:** Announced their 1W3 Buildathon, submissions are accepted [here](https://submit.1w3.eth.limo). They also notified the community that Deform is now supported by 1W3.

**3. Namehash Labs | @lightwalker.eth:** Namehash Labs is an innovation network working on open source ENS-focused infrastructure and public goods. They've announced two projects:

* **Nameguard**: Identifies impersonation attempts using ENS names. Features include ENS health checks, Smart Auto-Renewal, and ENS Profile Completion Score. Participating in ENS‚Äôs Small Grants round.
* **NameKit**: Aims to reduce the cost and complexity of implementing ENS on wallets and dApps. It has four distinct ENS journeys: Find your ENS identity, Design your ENS identity, Interact with others, Manage your ENS identity. Will be open source and released by the end of 2023.

**4.** [**Icann-o-Worms**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/icann-o-worms-introducing-a-dns-implementation-of-ens-for-public-nameservers-and-the-eth-tld/17875) **| @ethlimo.eth:**

The ethlimo.eth team presented limo-web3-dns, a domain-specific iteration of the DNS protocol for direct ENS record resolution. This nameserver will augment traditional DNS functionality to include on-chain ENS domain records, aiming for seamless resolution via network-capable clients, to achieve trustless, auditable, and cryptographically signed ENS over DNS.

**5.** [**World Wide Web3**](https://app.madeindreams.ca) **| Ian:**

World Wide Web3 (WWW3) is a novel platform that empowers users to cryptographically sign messages and pin them on a global map, with their ENS identity serving as their unique identifier. This innovation has sparked discussions around its potential applications in travel and proof-of-location scenarios. Although WWW3 is still in its beta phase and operates on a testnet, it holds promise for fostering a new wave of location-based interactions in the decentralized digital realm.
