### ‚≠êÔ∏è ENS Guide

ENS allows users to associate avatars with their ENS names, enhancing personalization. These avatars can be a straightforward picture or can be represented using other NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). To set an avatar, users should visit the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app), connecting with the designated wallet for their ENS name. After selecting the intended ENS name and accessing profile settings, a camera icon provides a submenu for avatar settings. Users can either upload an image directly from their computer or choose an NFT from their wallet. After cropping, signing, and uploading the image, it's crucial to save and confirm the changes, then proceed to sign a blockchain transaction to finalize the update. Once completed, the avatar becomes visible on the ENS name page. It can be viewed on platforms like the ENS Manager App and Uniswap, while OpenSea showcases it differently. For a detailed walkthrough and troubleshooting, visit [ENS's support page](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7883271-how-to-set-an-avatar). ‚Äî 09.15.23

### üåê Community Updates

#### Namestone: What is ENS?

In a recent blog post, [NameStone](https://namestone.xyz), a B2B company specializing in providing gasless ENS subnames, provided a comprehensive overview of the ENS. They acknowledged that understanding ENS can be challenging for crypto newcomers. At its core, ENS is like a "web3 version" of the traditional Domain Name System (DNS), converting lengthy Ethereum addresses into easily recognizable names ending in ".eth". These names aren't just domains but are considered entire social identities, thanks to the data they can store. Operating as ERC721 NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), ENS names offer various advantages, from decentralized ownership to enhanced user experiences in decentralized applications. A notable feature is the ability to have offchain ENS subdomains, which are cost-effective and offer immense potential for both personal and business applications. Those interested in the broader potential of ENS can learn more through [NameStone's blog](https://namestone.xyz/blog/what-is-ens). ‚Äî 09.14.23

‚Äî

#### NameSys Updates

[NameSys](http://namesys.xyz) announced the launch of its v1.1. Including new features like the inclusion of an array of new records such as Address (ETH), Address (BTC), Avatar, Contenthash, and several others. Users can opt for a custom HTTP Gateway for records storage, which facilitates faster resolution. NameSys provides its own HTTP Gateway, enabling users to save on gas expenses by migrating the Resolver through a single transaction. Stealth Payments, allow encrypted interactions between two users via their unique RSA (2048 BITS) public key records (ie. Bob can issue an encrypted invoice to Alice, who can decrypt and fulfill the invoice). [According to their update](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/namesys-new-records-http-support-and-stealth-payments/17741?u=estmcmxci) when juxtaposed with UmbraCash, NameSys's method is 99% more economical and assures heightened privacy by eliminating on-chain logs. The team conveyed their gratitude to the ENS DAO for their unwavering support through the Ecosystem Grant and welcomed any questions or comments from the community. ‚Äî 09.11.23

#### Community Discussion: Pairwise Voting

In recent observations of DAO voting mechanisms, @Zeptimus [has pointed out](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/conviction-voting-in-ens-small-grants/16789/14?u=estmcmxci) that conviction voting within ENS Small Grants has shown potential inefficiencies in fund allocation. They've introduced Pairwise Voting‚Äîan innovative mechanism aiming to streamline decisions and bolster participation. Designed akin to a Tinder-style interface, voters are presented with a choice between two projects, simplifying the otherwise daunting process of choosing from numerous proposals. This ensures all projects get a fair shot, sidestepping the common issue of voters gravitating towards familiar options. Using an ELO system, proposals are ranked based on voters' preferences. Once rankings are established, there's a provision to revise votes, adding a personal touch to the process, a feature in the pipeline for Optimism. For ENS Small Grants, Pairwise can redefine fund allocation. It could endorse rank choice voting, with the top projects earning ETH. Alternatively, if a project wins a vote against another, it secures a percentage of the total grant, ensuring a fair distribution based on collective preference. @Nick.eth has indicated their interest in having the DAO experiment with this method, too. ‚Äî 09.13.23

#### Community Proposal: ENS on Swarm

In a recent proposal titled ["ENS on Swarm"](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-on-swarm-decentralized-storage/17642?u=estmcmxci), @costgallo introduced an off-chain solution for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) on the P2P storage network, [Swarm](https://www.ethswarm.org/). The approach addresses challenges like high operational fees and service availability by proposing a decentralized off-chain resolver for name resolution. The system uses "Identity Addressing" via the Single Owner Chunk (SOC) from Swarm, enabling users to securely address and upload data based on their Ethereum address. By allowing records to be uploaded and versioned off-chain, it provides a faster, cost-effective alternative to the existing on-chain process. Furthermore, the proposal suggests possible data structures for streamlined subdomain handling and emphasizes the need for JavaScript developers familiar with ENS and Swarm for implementation. This new paradigm promises a more efficient, trustworthy, and decentralized name resolution system. ‚Äî 09.15.23

#### September DAO Voting Window

Proposals under discussion in the governance forum are set for a vote on [September 28th](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/september-dao-voting-window/17788?u=estmcmxci). Notably, executable proposals have a voting duration of seven days, while social ones last five days. This structured voting timeframe was initiated based on delegate feedback aimed at simplifying voting periods, thereby making it less demanding for delegates. The Meta-Governance team is overseeing the scheduling of these votes. Some proposals are yet to be finalized, with updates anticipated as the month closes.

Two expected executable proposals are: (1) [Allocating the second segment of the endowment](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-4-x-executable-fund-the-endowment-second-tranche/17743?u=estmcmxci), consisting of 16,000 ETH, from the ENS DAO to the ENS Endowment run by Karpatkey. (2) [Proposing refunds for costs related to .eth names](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-refund-eth-names-affected-by-normalization-updates/17622/2), which might be impacted due to changes in the name normalization standard.

Additionally, there's a potential social proposal concerning a vulnerability wherein a malevolent DAO update might decrease the registration term of .eth 2LDs. The outcome of this social vote will gauge the community's stance on proposed contractual changes meant to address this issue. This voting approach is based on past feedback, and the organizers continue to invite more suggestions and opinions for improvement. ‚Äî 09.20.23

The ENS DAO Public Goods Working Group has continued their focus on Zero-Knowledge (ZK) methods and the P256 implementation. Their interest in this area is fueled by a collective aim to understand and facilitate improved blockchain scalability and privacy.

@Coltron.eth, recently participated in the "funding the commons" event. He returned with insights, having engaged with multiple projects at the forefront of this domain.

Here's a brief overview of some of the notable projects and platforms he discussed:

1. Privacy + Scaling Explorations: One platform that particularly caught the group's attention was pse.dev. This platform is deeply engaged in researching methods to enhance both the privacy and scalability of blockchain technologies. By combining these two focus areas, they aim to bring about a revolution in how blockchain technologies are perceived and utilized.
2. noseedphrases.xyz: Another intriguing project highlighted by Coltron. While the specifics of its function and purpose remain a topic of exploration, it is evident that it holds potential significance in the context of public goods and blockchain advancement.
3. ZK WebAuthn: This is a fascinating initiative that's employing Zero-Knowledge proofs in the authentication space. Given the ubiquitous nature of web authentication processes today, integrating ZK methods can drastically bolster security and privacy for users.

A significant reference that the working group is currently studying is a [paper published by Ledger](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/939.pdf). This paper illuminates the potential of a decrease in gas costs for p256 signature verification. Such a reduction can pave the way for more efficient and economical blockchain operations.

Furthermore, there is a growing buzz around "Speeding up elliptic computations for Ethereum Account Abstraction." This topic, although technically dense, holds the potential to redefine how computations on the Ethereum blockchain are handled, making them more efficient and faster. ‚Äî 09.12.23

#### Project Highlights: Kiwi News

Last week, [Kiwi News](https://news.kiwistand.com/), a groundbreaking web3 alternative to the tech-centric platform, Hackernews, was unveiled by its creators, [Tim Daub](https://twitter.com/timdaub) and [Mac Budkowski](https://twitter.com/macBudkowski/). Unlike traditional news websites, Kiwi News integrates pioneering features like 'Sign in with Ethereum' for user login and incorporates ENS for streamlined account data management. An intriguing aspect of the site was the leaderboard that spotlighted profiles with the highest number of upvoted posts. The platform's foundation rests on an open, decentralized peer-to-peer protocol, a feature elaborated in their Protocol Guide. With its promising attributes, Kiwi News has set its sights on the upcoming Small Grants round, soliciting the community's support and votes. Moreover, the community had a golden opportunity to delve deeper into the project's nuances as the team presented at the Protocol Berg event in Berlin on September 15, 2023. ‚Äî 09.14.23

#### Streamlining Queries

@Limes is in the process of launching a new email address dedicated to ENS domain inquiries. This move aims to streamline communication and ensure that all ENS-related queries are addressed promptly and efficiently. To ensure organization and proper delegation, the email account will be under the supervision of the Secretary. They will be responsible for sifting through incoming questions and redirecting them to the relevant parties for resolution. This initiative highlights the Ecosystem Working Group's commitment to enhancing user experience and improving accessibility for its audience. ‚Äî 09.21.23
