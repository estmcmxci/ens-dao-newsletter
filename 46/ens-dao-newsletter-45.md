### üåê Community Updates

#### [ICANN-o-worms](https://x.com/eth\_limo/status/1708886269353193569?s=20) | ETHLimo

The team at eth.limo initiated the development of limo-web3-dns, an avant-garde domain-specific adaptation of the DNS protocol tailored for direct resolution of ENS records. This endeavor aims to enhance traditional DNS functionality by incorporating on-chain ENS domain records, facilitating unmediated resolution through most network-savvy clients. The motivation stems from the ENS leading decentralized edge over Web2 DNS services, coupled with the imminent .eth TLD's entry into the ICANN domain. Given the contemporary issues like centralization risks by registrar-centric nameserver infrastructures and compatibility challenges between Web2 DNS and ENS content fields, the project emphasizes community operation, native ENS resolution extensions, cryptographic verification, and more. They welcome collaborative contributions to their open-source endeavor, join the [discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/icann-o-worms-introducing-a-dns-implementation-of-ens-for-public-nameservers-and-the-eth-tld/17875). ‚Äî 10.02.23

#### Endowment Updates

The community raised concerns about Karpatkey's heavy reliance on LIDO's stETH token in their investment strategies, noting LIDO's substantial 32.26% stake of all staked ETH. Despite Karpatkey's current 70%/30% stETH/rETH strategy, they have set an objective for a 20%/50%/30% stETH/rETH/Other LSTs split. They emphasized the risks of moving away from a trusted token like stETH. While there were suggestions to cap or completely divest from stETH, the majority consensus leaned towards a 20% exposure. Karpatkey intends to reduce their LIDO exposure to this level by October's end and will soon release a detailed plan for community feedback. ‚Äî 10.03.23

‚Äî

#### DAO Tooling

Pairwise, introduced by @Griff, is a pioneering voting tool designed to simplify complex decision-making processes involving multiple variables, such as selecting from numerous small grant projects. Instead of being overwhelmed by numerous choices, users are presented with a series of "This-or-That" decisions between two projects. After responding to these paired decisions, users receive a proposed ranked list for submission. While still in its prototype stage, ENS is considering incorporating Pairwise in their upcoming small grants round to streamline the voting experience. They would appreciate your support for their small grants initiative. ‚Äî 10.03.23

#### Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP) | Presented by @brantlymillegan

EFP is a decentralized system, crafted to empower Ethereum account holders to manage curated lists of other Ethereum accounts. This offers a spectrum of applications, from creating a web3 social structure native to the Ethereum community, establishing a web of trust, collating lists of reliable smart contracts vital for dapps, enabling onchain follow trading, to various other functionalities. Brantly highlights a vision of Ethereum evolving with a web3 identity framework. Components of this framework include SIWE, ENS, NFT profile pictures, and more. However, a noticeable gap is the absence of a mechanism to establish relationships between accounts. Unlike prevalent protocols that strive to monopolize the identity stack, [EFP](https://twitter.com/ethfollowpr) aims to complement protocols like ENS, enhancing their functionality. ‚Äî 10.03.23

‚Äî

#### Quadratic Funding on Giveth | Presented by Lauren Luz & Jacob Schumacher

#### NameGuard | Presented by @lightwalker.eth

NameGuard is an upcoming project by the Namehash team. Set to launch in late October, NameGuard is an open-source infrastructure designed to bolster the security of ENS. This initiative, as detailed in their small grants submission titled "[NameGuard - Security ‚ÄúX-ray](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/30/proposals/815)‚Äù, aims to shield users from concealed threats in ENS names, specifically addressing concerns like inbound message or transaction impersonation and deceptive activities on platforms such as OpenSea. To achieve its objectives, NameGuard will offer a comprehensive suite, including a library, API, typescript client, UI kit, and web app, dedicated to identifying vulnerabilities across various analytical layers, ranging from name structures to specific code points. Lightwalker encourages inquiries and is open to potential integrations to amplify the platform's security protocols. ‚Äî 10.05.23

> "The goal for NameGuard is to help protect the ENS community from hidden risks or limitations in ENS names, such as impersonation attacks in web3 social messengers, fake "ENS" NFTs on OpenSea, confusables that still pass ens\_normalize on marketplaces such as http://ens.vision, and more." ‚Äî Lightwalker.eth

‚Äî

#### OnThis | Presented by [Igor Yuzo](https://twitter.com/igoryuzo)

[OnThis](https://onthis.xyz) specializes in creating shortcuts for seamless contract interactions through simple ETH transactions. Such functionalities can be seen in tasks like NFT mints or staking on LIDO. At the ETHGlobal NY Hackathon, OnThis showcased their innovation with a shortcut for 10xbull.eth. By merely sending ETH to this address, a trade is activated on GMX, an options project on Arbitrum, directly from the mainnet. Recognizing its potential to simplify intent into action, ENS awarded OnThis with a prize for the best use case. ‚Äî 10.05.23
