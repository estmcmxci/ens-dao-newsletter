As part of Gitcoin Grants Round 14, ENS is providing a matching pool of $42K for [projects supporting the mission of ENS and ENS DAO.](https://gitcoin.co/grants/clr/gr14-ens) There is one more week remaining in the grants round.

### üì∞ Working Group News

#### üë•[ Community](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/community/12)

_**The Community Working Group dissolution proposal vote**_ [_**concluded today**_](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa64ec8b446e509cb4b75092c4a714897790b70e2711fc3d6afa969c250e7eb92)_**.**_

The voting record and [forum discussion](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep14-social-dissolve-community-working-group/12982) indicated that Community Stewards had differing opinions. The steward votes at Midnight June 15th were:

| Steward        | Voting Recorded                                                                                             |

**Communications Subgroup**

@estmcmxci has been assisting @daylon.eth with the newsletter, and the newsletter has it's own [Gitcoin Grants page](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4861/ens-dao-newsletter-ensdaonewseth).

**ENS DAO @ ETHNewYork**

There will be a small event on Friday, June 24th from 6-9pm in Manhattan for DAO members and those with ENS Names. This will be a token-gated event with $ENS holders having early access to the RVSP. Small Plates, ENS DAO t-shirts, ENS Hats(limited run), and an event POAP will be available to attendees.

The official announcement will take place on the [ENS DAO twitter account.](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO)

**Translation Subgroup**

The translation subgroup has paid a contributor for Russian translations, but the Learn Docs redesign currently blocks work. @coltron.eth expect that @estmcmxci will be able to slowly start the translations with one or two contributors this week. This slow start aims to identify any technical bugs before opening this to a broader group of translations.

The main technical hang-up has been integrating the search functionality in a way compatible with globalization. @coltron.eth is coordinating this project with an outside developer to move quickly. This is a top priority project to have buttoned up before the end of the term. The final result from this delay should be a lasting solution that can be improved and scaled with our document libraries.

**Merch Store RFP**

The submission period for the ENS DAO Merch store RFP closed last week. The fours submissions can be [viewed on the forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/prfp-ens-dao-merch-store/12707/11?u=coltron.eth).

Following the current public question period, @coltron.eth and @spencecoin will initiate a DAO-wide vote at their discretion.

**Code of Conduct**

A draft proposal of ENS DAO's Code of Conduct has been published on the forum.

> _Description_ The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to create a robust working culture that encourages high standards for inclusivity, representation and respect. This is a high impact document that serves as one of the DAO‚Äôs foundations for a thriving and globally focused ecosystem.

> _Abstract_ This is a proposal to officiate the proposed Code of Conduct, drafted by a myriad of Stewards and Contributors.

> The Code of Conduct guides participants of the ENS DAO towards a course of best action, as well as illustrating cultural practices that observe and respect individual agency and will to power.

> The Code of Conduct also introduces the concept of Dynamic Proposals, which are subject to bi-annual revision by Council.

Review the proposed Code of Conduct [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-social-code-of-conduct-2022/13084?u=estmcmxci). The Code of Conduct is slated to go up for a vote on Snapshot on or before the beginning of Term 2, July 1, 2022 (UTC).

#### üó∫Ô∏è _Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes_

The ENS DAO is a unique protocol in that its user base has a wider variety of participants from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Thus far, in DeFi and Web3, the end user has been the builder, the investor, and the speculator. The ENS Protocol represents an opportunity for Web3 to impact the real world.

We need a focused initiative to prime different ecosystems to use ENS for small business initiatives. The Futurx collaboration with Nicol√°s Madorey is one such example.

This work is more focused on public outreach. This means hosting workshops online in different languages across different disciplines demonstrating ENS use cases. It also means hosting IRL, local events that are backed by the ENS DAO.

It's important to consider a grants program for Culture & Diversity initiatives that align with the ENS Ecosystem long-term vision. This could include an ENS backed arts, culture and diversity grant program that could be developed under the Ecosystem Working Group.

Example: [Futurx x ENS Proposed Collaboration](https://hackmd.io/OBrYUZzNR86eAPVK9m-Xkw?view)

In Term 2, we may move away from titling this Subgroup as is, and reconsider a more inclusive, globally and culturally focused title such as "Culture & Diversity". We will also push to establish rapport with Communities through written collaborative pieces on the Utility of ENS within their ecosystem, to be hosted on the ENS DAO Mirror.

#### üîÑ[ Ecosystem](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-ecosystem/32)

ENS Ecosystem: related to the continuing development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem, with a focus on all technical matters related to ENS.

The Ecosystem Working Group held two meetings in early June, on the 7th and 13th. More information about what was discussed in the meetings can be found here:

* [Weekly Ecosystem Meeting, June 7, 2022](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/agenda-for-weekly-ecosystem-meeting-june-7-2022-1am-gmt/13127)
* [Weekly Ecosystem Meeting, June 13, 2022](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/agenda-for-weekly-ecosystem-meeting-june-13-2022-7pm-gmt/13245)

#### ‚öñÔ∏è [Meta-Governance](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/meta-governance/28)

Meta-Governance: related to DAO governance and management

#### ‚úÖ [Public Goods](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/public-goods/37)

Public Goods: related to the amplification of ENS as a Public Good and funding Public Goods within the ENS ecosystem and more broadly in web3.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Utility

> We need web3 builders who will:\

> \-take some risks with their GTM (explore different user segments and channels)\
