### 📝 DAO-Wide Updates

#### Treasury Management Proposals

On November 29th, **nick.eth** submitted what would be the first of two treasury management proposals, [Routine DAO Treasury Management](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-routine-dao-treasury-management/15501). The proposal details basic parameters regarding DAO working capital and runway.

[**nick.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/nick.eth/summary) on Treasury Management: [¹](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-routine-dao-treasury-management/15501)

> Presently the DAO keeps almost all of its treasury funds in ETH, and has not heretofore had a standard process for converting income to stablecoins in order to fund ongoing operations. This EP proposes standard expectations for the DAO to follow, specifying expected balances and actions to be taken on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the DAO continues to be able to execute on its goals effectively.

Several days later, **james.eth** submitted [a second treasury management proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-routine-dao-treasury-management/15501), which focuses on ensuring the DAO has enough stable runway to pay contributors for at least 18 months.

[**james.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/james/summary) on Treasury Management: [²](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-dao-treasury-management/15576/18?u=estmcmxci)

> Currently the DAO keeps almost 100% of it’s treasury in ETH, although ENS as a protocol is almost entirely focused on Ethereum, having this much exposure to one asset leaves the DAO, its contributors, and its sustainability in a potentially vulnerable position.

The proposals have their distinctions. Delegates and $ENS holders should read each carefully and arrive to respective conclusions about each.

#### Ecosystem Grantees Updates

**Planetable.xyz**, a native macOS app for building, browsing and following decentralized web content with IPFS and ENS, shared an update with the community. They've recently added a _Connect Wallet_ feature in their app for tipping ENS domain content creators.

> We recently added Connect Wallet feature in our app for tipping [@ensdomains](https://twitter.com/ensdomains?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ENS content creators. This feature is a lot of fun to implement. Planet is probably the first macOS native app to have WalletConnect. [https://t.co/FvIQPuxe6w](https://t.co/FvIQPuxe6w) [pic.twitter.com/voQIDeBgBn](https://t.co/voQIDeBgBn)

**Nimi**, a web3 project that offers similar linking features to _Linktree_, shared a year-end cap of what they've accomplished using the grant they received from ENS DAO.
