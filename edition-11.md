@Sinestia presented [Community Name Service (CNS) ](https://twitter.com/CNSdomains)which enables conditional ENS subdomains to be registered and distributed to communities. CNS implements soulbound tokens and are planning to integrate the ENS Name Wrapper as well. This project is open-source, builds ontop of the ENS Protocol, and makes issuing subdomains easier.

**III. ENS Project Highlight**

Makoto.eth issued the State of ENS at EthCC in Paris on July 20th, 2022. Updates include the imminent arrival of ENS Name Wrapper which grants the ability to turn any .eth name into a ERC1155 NFT. Wrapping a .eth domain enables the parent domain to restrict what can occur with subdomains. The name wrapper works by introducing the concept of fuses (rights), each fuse can be enabled/disabled permanently & irrevocably.
