#### :globe\_with\_meridians: [DAO-Wide](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/dao-wide/48)

**Alisha.eth** has proposed amendments to Working Groups according to [EP4](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules). [Review the Draft Proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-social-working-group-rules/12953).

_The proposed amendments are:_

1. Amend rule 4.6 to change ‚ÄúMarch‚Äù to ‚ÄúApril‚Äù.
2. Amend rule 4.6 to make the Funding Window last the whole month rather than the last 15 days of the month.
3. Add a new rule in rule 4.5 stating that each WG must appoint a lead steward.
4. Amend rule 4.1 to take the number of WG stewards in each WG down from five to three.
5. Remove the requirement for TNL stewards in WGs by removing rule 8.2 and amending rule 8.3.
6. Amend rule 9.1.2 to state that stewards can only be removed by a vote of the majority of elected stewards across all WGs.

Edit: [\[EP12\] is live on Snapshot now.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xc7186cf8bebe47600f8d847e76f7971ea97b48bc04eda1e07780aff91fb6410d)

_Current Working Groups:_

1. **Meta-Governance:** related to DAO governance and management
2. **ENS Ecosystem:** related to the continuing development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem, with a focus on all technical matters related to ENS
3. **Community:** related to the people and organisations that are users of ENS, with a focus on non-technical matters
4. **Public Goods:** related to the amplification of ENS as a Public Good and funding Public Goods within the ENS ecosystem and more broadly in web3

#### Dissolving the Community Working Group

**Alisha.eth** has also proposed to dissolve the Community Working Group

The rationale per **Alisha.eth:**

> The distinction between the working groups will be more clear to both delegates and DAO contributors if the Community working group sits under the ENS Ecosystem working group. In that case:
>
> * MetaGov deals with matters related to the DAO and governance;
> * ENS Ecosystem deals with matters related to the ENS Protocol; and
> * Public Goods relates to supporting public goods within the ENS ecosystem and more broadly in web3.

You can review the Draft Proposal on the forum and join the discussion [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-social-dissolve-community-working-group/12982).

#### :busts\_in\_silhouette:[ Community](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/community/12)

**Merch RFP**

The Community WG have outlined a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an ENS DAO Merch store. Prepared by Coltron.eth, the winning bid of the RFP will establish an online portal that allows for the sale of officially branded ENS and ENS DAO merchandise for public purchase and global fulfillment. The ‚Äúoperator‚Äù will also be responsible for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of The Store and the various customer orders:

* A template will be provided for applicants.
* Submissions will be open for 14 days
* A question period will open following the submission period.
* Stewards will select a chosen applicant(s) to present to the DAO for a vote.
* Work begins.

You can read more about the RFP [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/request-for-review-merch-store-rfp/12656).

**IRL Outreach**

* The ENS DAO is hosting a low-key mixer during [@ETHGlobal](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal)'s ETHNYC.
* 120 ENS DAO Branded shirts have been ordered ahead of ETHNYC
* A POAP has been designed for ETHNYC; [the winner](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/poap-design-contest/12666/18) was decided via a POAPathon.

**Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes**

[**@estmcmxci** ](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/estmcmxci)hosted the first ENS LatAm spaces on May 18th. Cordobes.eth & Nicol√°s (Futurx.eth) opened up to discuss ENS utility in their region (Argentina). Bi-weekly LatAm ENS Spaces are being planned.

As for the ENS LatAm workshop, Coltron.eth suggested to reference Makoto‚Äôs Speakerdeck and translate relevant content from ENG to ESP.

Reference: [Makoto Inoue (@makoto\_inoue) on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/makoto\_inoue)

**Translation**

In the matter of the Translation Subgroup, the Community Stewards are working with ENS Lead Developer Makoto to develop a backend solution for Language Localization at scale.

**Onboarding**

Lead Coordinator Eduardo Vega-Pati√±o (@vegayp), is setting up the DAO's coordination layer; currently testing [@ZenHubHQ](https://twitter.com/ZenHubHQ). He continues to run [weekly onboarding calls](http://meet.google.com/gvg-bkdk-xaa) (Friday @ 1:30PM EST).

#### :arrows\_counterclockwise:[ Ecosystem](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-ecosystem/32)

**ENS Avatar RFP**

The ENS DAO is launching a project to include a [generative PFP](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/prfp-ens-avatar-pfp/12760) builder into the platform. The project‚Äôs goal will be to provide ENS users with a unique PFP with randomized traits, conceptually similar to modern NFT collections.

Users will have the ability to select this PFP generator as an alternative to manually populating the ENS record avatar field. The randomized avatar will be a derivative of the ENS name. Each ENS name will always resolve to the same single permutation of the avatar regardless of ownership transfers.

_Editors note: We really like new member @ColorUnit's RFP_ [_submission_.](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/prfp-ens-avatar-pfp/12760/25?u=estmcmxci) _This RFP is currently OPEN._

**Welcome TNL Executive Director: Khori Whittaker!**

True Names is delighted to announce that Khori Whittaker will be joining TNL later this month as our new Executive Director. Khori's extensive experience with both non-profits + Web3 will play a vital role in moving TNL forward, as we build ENS out for the next million users. Whittaker ([@khoriwhittaker](https://twitter.com/KhoriWhittaker)) began his career as a fifth-grade teacher in Long Beach, California, via the [@TeachForAmerica](https://twitter.com/TeachForAmerica) program.

**10K Club**

_**Aaron Oxborrow**_ _of 10k Club_ soft launched the bulk registration tool at [ENS Vision](https://www.ens.vision/) and noticed an uptick of new registrations while saving the users time and gas by setting all of the configurations at once-with bulk options.

[**IPFS Nodes for Pinning .eth Websites**](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ipfs-nodes-for-pinning-eth-websites/12662)**.**

_**Gregskril.eth**_ hosted a call for [IPFS Nodes for Pinning .eth Websites](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ipfs-nodes-for-pinning-eth-websites/12662):

> _‚ÄúIn our conversations, we realized that all of these services use_ [_Pinata‚Äôs API 2_ ](https://docs.pinata.cloud/)_to upload/pin files to IPFS. This works perfectly as an on-ramp, but feels like a loss for decentralization. Content on IPFS is only accessible for as long it is pinned, so relying on a single commercial service to be the sole pinner of all .eth websites is not ideal in the long term.‚Äù_

You can review notes from the call [here](https://gregskril.notion.site/69466439d2b74555ab3cd0252a4862c0).

#### :balance\_scale: [Meta-Governance](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/meta-governance/28)

**Code of Conduct (CoC)**

The Code of Conduct (CoC) is now under the purview of the Meta-Governance Working Group. Meta-Governance Steward @simona\_pop will work together with the CoC's Lead Coordinator @estmcmxci to finalize the draft.

**Analytics**

Lead Coordinator @inplco is forming an analytics subgroup of the Meta-Governance Working Group. The LC will coordinate w/ [@showkarma\_xyz](https://twitter.com/showkarma\_xyz) to pull engagement data for Contributors, Stewards & Delegates from Discourse to generate the first ENS DAO Governance Report.

Minutes from the Subgroup‚Äôs first meeting are [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/meeting-analytics-research-subwg/12801).

#### :white\_check\_mark: [Public Goods](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/public-goods/37)

**Protocol Guild**

The Public Goods Working Group is in favor of using up to 10% of unclaimed airdrop tokens to incentivize core [@ethereum](https://twitter.com/ethereum) developers. More info can be found [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-public-goods-meeting-may-10-should-we-use-part-of-the-unclaimed-airdrops-to-incentivize-core-ethereum-developers/12620).

[Protocol Guild Draft](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/52) has been gaining momentum. This is a proposal for the ENS DAO to support a vested split contract which directs funding to 110 Ethereum core protocol contributors over one year.

ENS sponsorship of the Guild allows members to engage with ENS in a way that is values and incentive aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications that run on top of it.

Edit: [\[EP13\] is live on Snapshot now.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b)

**ENS Small Grants**

@carlosdp of [Metaphor.xyz](http://metaphor.xyz) is proposing an ENS Small Grants Program. Outlined [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843), the ENS Small Grants Program aims to allow working groups to setup a low-friction way to ask the DAO for small/starter funding for Public Goods and/or ecosystem projects.

**Never sign a crypto wallet transaction without being certain of what you are signing.** [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) is currently the most common method attackers are using to gain access to a victim‚Äôs wallet. If you don‚Äôt know what your wallet is asking you to agree to and why, _close the window!_
