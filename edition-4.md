New editions are **published on the 1st and 15th of each month** on the [ENS DAO Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/), [Substack](https://ensdaonews.substack.com/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ensdaonews). We encourage any feedback, questions, or comments!

#### Last Call to Claim $ENS Airdrop!

There is **less than three weeks left** to claim your $ENS airdrop if you haven't done so already! The snapshot took place on Oct 31, 2021. You can check if you're eligible at [**claim.ens.domains**](http://claim.ens.domains). After May 4th outstanding $ENS will be sent to the ENS DAO treasury!

#### ENS NFTs!

* The second ENS NFT drop in collaboration with [@Galaxisxyz](https://twitter.com/Galaxisxyz) is nearly here!
* To enter, make sure your ENS name is in your Twitter handle, then [retweet this tweet](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO/status/1514372958143541248) with what you would offer the fae in return for one of their NFTs.
* The best 144 answers will win the Summer Knight NFT!

### ENS DAO Governance

* Final voting for EP7, EP8, and EP10 on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x323A76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2A560C6a395b7E3) was completed, with all proposals being passed.
* A date for final voting on EP9 will be announced soon. Although consensus was already signaled on _Snapshot_, this final vote on _Tally_ is necessary to execute changes put forward in proposals that require new code to be deployed on the blockchain.
* @rocco has provided [Updates on EP10 - Community Run Identity Server (Mid-April)](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updates-on-ep10-community-run-identity-server-mid-april/11996)

### **UPDATE**: 04/20

#### EP9 Voting on Tally

Onchain voting for EP9 is now live on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x323A76393544d5ecca80cd6ef2A560C6a395b7E3/proposal/107166664722174233740232174220463354481004128961821575530758100250899337476509)! This proposal replaces the current price oracle with one that uses an exponential decay for expired names - meaning their premium will start at $100M and halve daily for 21 days until reaching zero.

### üì∞ Working Group News

The EP7 proposals allocating funding to our four Working Groups were passed and executed on chain. The requested WG funds are now in their respective multi-signature wallets, the details of which can be seen on [Orca](https://pod.xyz/user/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7).

If you would like to contribute to the development of ENS, [please contact a Steward.](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/q1-q2-2022-steward-announcement)

#### [üë• Community](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/community/12)

**Community WG Operations**

* The Community Working Group reviewed the different treasury management tools over the past two weeks and has decided to use [Parcel](https://parcel.money/). The decision was difficult because the tools available have a lot in common. Ultimately, Parcel was chosen because of its simple UI and the advertised ability for contributors to take an active role in managing payments through the [delegate access](https://parceldocs.gitbook.io/parcel-docs/for-dao-operators/delegate-access) feature. @coltron.eth wrote a [draft post](https://hackmd.io/@Coltron/rk7itvmNq) explaining the case for these tools.
  * The working group is connecting their Gnosis Safe this week and expects to make a retroactive payment for work performed NLT (04/16) to compensate for the first 2.5 months of DAO Operations.
  * For now, regular payments for the Community WG can be expected every month, with normal disbursements on the last Friday of each month. If there is a demonstrated time-critical need, payments may be approved out of this schedule.
* _Note:_ This decision only affects our working group and is low risk because there is no commitment, no cost, and is easily reverted if we want to switch.

**Onboarding**

* @vegayp and @coltron.eth continued to tinker with ideas on how to improve onboarding for the DAO and help create better spaces for information dissemination.
* @vegayp looked into using Zenhub for managing the different RFPs \[Request For Proposal] and projects that will happen in the Community WG. At the same time, @coltron.eth built out a Notion Dashboard to provide a landing page for new DAO members to have one stop for information.
* Weekly Onboarding continues to happen every Friday at 1:30 EST (6:30pm UTC) and is a one-hour open conversation about the ENS DAO. You can join via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/gvg-bkdk-xaa).

**Communications Subgroup**

* The Community Office Hours Summaries:
  * **Thursday 04/07:** @limes and @coltron.eth hosted @slobo.eth, talking about developing in the ENS Ecosystem, Slobo's Project NFTYchat, and how his personal experiences as a builder help him communicate as an ENS Ecosystem Steward.
  * **Wednesday 04/13:** @garypalmerjr spoke about his thoughts on the ENS DAO, building on subdomains, and marketing. @gregskril also introduced his new ENS Banner App that generates a Twitter Profile banner based upon ENS Metadata.

**Translation Subgroup**

* @estmcmxci has prepared an on-spec Translation Program for the ENS DAO Learn Docs and has posted it on the Forum for feedback.
* Having prior experience with Translation work in other DAOs, @estmcmxci has recommended Crowdin as the tool of choice. The translation tool can integrate with the ENS Gitbook Repo and pull text directly from the Learn Docs therein.
* You can check out his prior work from time spent on the W\&M Research DAO [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-learn-docs-translation-program-espanol/11973) and learn more about the Translation Program [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-learn-docs-translation-program-espanol/11973).

**Code of Conduct**

* Moving forward, this will be worked on in partnership with the Meta-Governance Working Group. There is an overlapping responsibility on this topic. This a high-priority for both WGs and will be moved forward, after applying the community input, in alignment with the new RFP process. Read the draft [here](https://hackmd.io/@estmcmxci/ENS-Code-of-Conduct) and the thread on the forum [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-ens-code-of-conduct/11716), prepared by @estmcmxci with help from @spencecoin, @Coltron.eth and more.

#### üó∫Ô∏è _Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes_

* Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes opened [a thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/comunidad-para-hispanohablantes-initiatives-pool/11724) on the governance forum, _"to encourage members of the LatAm and Iberian ENS Community to share ideas."_
* In discussion with @futurx.eth, @estmcmxci is proposing a collaboration, in the form of a series of workshops that will be free to holders of .eth domain names. The workshop will walk through ENS‚Äô ecosystems, participation in Web3, community driven initiatives, music initiatives, and public goods.
* @futurx.eth has spent over 15 years working around of cultural institutions in LatAm including Argentina‚Äôs Ministerio de Cultura, British Council and more recently participating in UNESCO‚Äôs culture initiatives, is leading LatAm‚Äôs Web3 communities into the Future.
* @estmcmxci has identified Futurx‚Äôs initiatives are aligned with ENS‚Äô values: accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity.
* This initiative will focus on the LatAm and Iberian communities within ENS and will be transcribed in Spanish.

### üîí Security Tip

**Beware of bots and scammers** There is currently an epidemic across all of the big tech platforms, including Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Bot accounts and scammers are rampantly trying to steal victims information and drain their crypto wallets, and are unfortunately very often successful. It has gotten so bad that it is now best practice to not believe _anything_ or _anyone_ claiming to offer assistance through these social media accounts.

Wherever there is money to be made, scammers will be there to exploit the naivety and trust of unsuspecting victims. Cryptocurrency and NFT transactions are non-reversible, and are outside of typical centralized protections should you make a mistake. **It is always better to be safe than sorry.**
