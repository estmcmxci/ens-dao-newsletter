## Overview

ENS DAO Newsletter's primary objective will be to ensure consistent and informative updates to the community, as well as creating a comprehensive and accessible archive of past editions. ENS DAO Newsletter has a history of being the source of the most pertinent, results-driven developments in ENS and the broader Ethereum ecosystem and we look to continue that effort.

As Marcus (@estmcmxci) continues to lead the newsletter, they will be responsible for researching, writing, and publishing the content. Compensation for all contributors will come from the newly created newsletter multi-sig, as specified in the funding request document.

By prioritizing archival content and strategic accessibility, the ENS DAO Newsletter aims to deliver valuable and relevant updates to the community while ensuring the preservation and accessibility of its content for future reference and use.
