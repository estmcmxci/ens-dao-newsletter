### 🧧 Year in Review

#### 💜 February

The ENS DAO Newsletter began coverage of Working Groups in the month of February.

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:11111"] :wave: **HELLO WORLD!**

Welcome to the very first edition of the Ethereum Name Service newsletter! Future editions of this newsletter will be **published on the 1st and 15th of each month** . This bi-weekly ENS digest is intended to provide ongoing transparency into the ever-improving ENS protocol as well as its diverse community – including detailed documentation from the Working Groups and information about upcoming technical developments.

We hope to provide the best coverage of both ENS _the technology_ and of the ENS DAO, or _“decentralized autonomous organization.”_ Information about our community meetings, proposals, and governance decisions will be compiled here, as well as the latest updates to the ENS protocol and ecosystem as a whole.

This publication intends to maintain a credibly neutral, non-biased, accurate, reliable, and curated single source for all things ENS. We intend to reach the widest audience possible. \[/quote]

\--

@daylon.eth, founder of the newsletter, offered the first edition in full which includes up-to-date coverage of the ENS DAO Working Groups, activity from within the governance forum, important tweets, working group calls, and more. The goal is to provide readers with the absolute best source of ENS news and information, as it happens.

We continue to provide a carefully curated summary of the latest governance proposals, working group discussions, protocol developments, calls to action, market news, and other developments within the wider ENS ecosystem.

**Thanks for sticking around!**

#### 🌈 March

ENS participated in Gitcoin Grants Round 13, offering a matching pool of **$69,420** from the ENS Ecosystem Working Group. Proposals passed that enabled the DAO to fund separate working groups.

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:11794"] **Gitcoin Grants Round 13 + ENS Ecosystem $69,420 Matching Pool** Our first ever [Gitcoin Grant ](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4861/ens-dao-newsletter)matching round has come to a close, and support from the community has been incredible! Gitcoin Grant Round 13 featured an additional $69,420 matching pool from the ENS Ecosystem Working Group for open source projects that advance education, usability, and integration of Ethereum Name Service and ENS DAO. \[/quote]

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:11794"] The EP7 proposals allocating funding to our four Working Groups were passed and executed on chain. The requested WG funds are now in their respective multi-signature wallets, the details of which can be seen on [Orca ](https://pod.xyz/user/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7).

If you would like to contribute to the development of ENS, [please contact a Steward.](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/q1-q2-2022-steward-announcement)

Our four groups are **Community** , **Ecosystem** , **Meta-Governance** , and **Public Goods** . \[/quote]

### 🌧 April

The $ENS airdrop claim came to a close on May 4th (ENS Anniversary). April also saw the rise of ENS NFT holders clubs like The 10k Club raise the trading volume to unprecedented heights. ENS DAO Newsletter editor @estmcmxci offered a retrospective on the cultural phenomenon, 10k Club, [which catalyzed the sales of ENS Domain Names in April 2022](https://musologia.substack.com/p/driving-global-decentralization-via). Translation initiatives for relevant learning documentation began, too.

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:12326"]

#### LAST call to claim $ENS airdrop tokens!

There is **only a few days remaining** to claim your $ENS airdrop if you haven’t done so already! The snapshot took place on Oct 31, 2021. You can check if you’re eligible at [**claim.ens.domains** ](http://claim.ens.domains). After May 4th outstanding $ENS will be sent back to treasury! \[/quote]

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:12326"]

#### The 10k Club

This past week the 10k Club purchased all variations of 000-999 and 0000-9999! The event generated around 3 million USD for DAO funds and contributed to the DAO racing towards to 1 million names registered mark!

The 10k Club dropped a POAP to commemorate this event. All addresses that had minted or owned a name at the block is eligible to claim. For information on this POAP, you can check out their official Twitter, [@10kClubOfficial ](https://twitter.com/10kClubOfficial)\[/quote]

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:12326"]

**Communications Subgroup**

* The Community Office Hours Summaries
  * **Thursday 04/22:** @limes and @Coltron.eth hosted @danielgothis, talking about ENS Domain sales. @garypalmerjr was also on stage answering questions. \[/quote]

\[quote="daylon.eth, post:1, topic:12326"]

**Translation Subgroup**

* @estmcmxci and @coltron.eth ran into a roadblock with the Crowdin integration. Our current GitHub structure does not work as expected. They are looking for alternative solutions and have included @nick.eth in this process. \[/quote]

### 🌸 May

Amendments to Working Group Rules were proposed, which included the dissolution of the Community Working Group. Rationale can be found below.

\[quote="estmcmxci, post:1, topic:13057"]

#### :globe\_with\_meridians: [DAO-Wide](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/dao-wide/48)

**Alisha.eth** has proposed amendments to Working Groups according to [EP4](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules). [Review the Draft Proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-social-working-group-rules/12953).

_The proposed amendments are:_

1. Amend rule 4.6 to change “March” to “April”.
2. Amend rule 4.6 to make the Funding Window last the whole month rather than the last 15 days of the month.
3. Add a new rule in rule 4.5 stating that each WG must appoint a lead steward.
4. Amend rule 4.1 to take the number of WG stewards in each WG down from five to three.
5. Remove the requirement for TNL stewards in WGs by removing rule 8.2 and amending rule 8.3.
6. Amend rule 9.1.2 to state that stewards can only be removed by a vote of the majority of elected stewards across all WGs. \[/quote]

\[quote="estmcmxci, post:1, topic:13057"]

#### Dissolving the Community Working Group

**Alisha.eth** has also proposed to dissolve the Community Working Group

The rationale per **Alisha.eth:**

> The distinction between the working groups will be more clear to both delegates and DAO contributors if the Community working group sits under the ENS Ecosystem working group. In that case:
>
> * MetaGov deals with matters related to the DAO and governance;
> * ENS Ecosystem deals with matters related to the ENS Protocol; and
> * Public Goods relates to supporting public goods within the ENS ecosystem and more broadly in web3. \[/quote]

\[quote="estmcmxci, post:1, topic:13057"] You can review the Draft Proposal on the forum and join the discussion [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-social-dissolve-community-working-group/12982). \[/quote]

### 🌞 June

ENS DAO Steward Elections implemented changes to Working Group Rules, which saw the number of Stewards reduced from 5 to 3 per group.

### 🌊 August

ENS DAO announced the first recipient of the ENS Ecosystem Fellowship. The Meta-Governance Working Group finalized the Endowment proposal which was set to a DAO vote that month.

\[quote="estmcmxci, post:1, topic:14247"]

#### [ENS Ecosystem Fellowship](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-ecosystem-fellowship/14133)

This term, the Ecosystem WG is running an experiment called the **ENS Ecosystem Fellowship.**

The purpose of the Fellowship program is to identify and support builders/developers who are actively creating and contributing within the ENS ecosystem, or have already made a significant impact in their contributions to ENS.

Fellows are selected based on their potential to make positive, long-lasting contributions to the ENS Ecosystem.

Each fellow will receive a grant to the value of US$50k for the Term, to encourage them to continue their work building and experimenting with ENS and to acknowledge their past impact on the ENS ecosystem.

The ENS Ecosystem Fellow for the second term of 2022 will be [**@gregskril.eth**](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/gregskril/summary)

This migration has been in development since the very first days of Ethereum, and represents the efforts of countless contributors working years on end. It isn’t an exaggeration to say that this is one of the most significant moments in cryptocurrency history, and we are happy to have shared it with you. \[/quote]

Originally proposed by Slobo.eth and advocated by Avsa.eth, the Platform Source Parameter is an ENS Improvement Proposal that encodes which website registered a .eth name; for example: how many registrations were done through ensfairy.xyz

“This proposal suggests a social convention that generates the secret from a combination of taking the first 6 characters of a namehash, add another 6 characters for extra data and combines it with the appropriate number of random bytes.”

The ENS manager app(and other name registration apps), already generates this ‘secret’ parameter for the Step 1 commit transaction when registering a name. By utilizing the first 12 characters of the ‘secret’ parameter, it would enable platforms to label and track analytics on registrations by leveraging the existing registrar contract.

This improvement would also facilitate identifying creators within the ENS Ecosystem that have provably demonstrated added value. It’s important to identify creators who develop the ecosystem. Retroactive funding works because you can detect what has already demonstrated value, instead of Stewards having to make bets on what they think could happen. The ENSIP would allow for visibility of high value-add ENS Ecosystem developers.

\[quote="estmcmxci, post:1, topic:15499"] **Ethereum Name Services Improvement Proposal (ENSIP):**

Xomia.eth and BambooJuice.eth of [Kola Labs](https://twitter.com/KolaMetaverse) have put forth a new ENSIP that features a process for retrieving audio media associated with an ENS domain.

Overview:

* Static PFP is insufficient for the personal and iterative web3 life. We are seeing a growing demand of multimedia formats such as music, audio and video because they are more dynamic and expressive. We call it Multimedia Identity (MI) . One can associate one or more MIs with an existing ENS domain, and play the audio or video inside metaverse or social platforms interoperably. This proposal will focus on audio.
