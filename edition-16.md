### 🇨🇴 Devcon Bogotá

#### ENS + POAP + IYK Custom Swag Collaboration

The custom ENS cards made in collaboration with IYK and POAP were a huge success - with all 2000 distributed to Devcon attendees. At times the queue reached a \~60 minute wait, and we appreciate everyone being patient!

#### ENS Cards Leaderboard

Competition was fierce to reach the top of the [ENS Cards Leaderboard](https://swag.ens.domains/leaderboard/), which ranks who could meet the most people and mint their custom POAP by tapping their ENS card with a phone.

10 year-old [**ethilio.eth**](https://app.poap.xyz/scan/0x64865cd27bd943cbf688a7b11f5aa24eca9c5e38) reached legendary status for his determination to reach the top, with several attendees stopping by the ENS booth to check his progress on the leaderboard and cheer him on throughout Devcon.

> Ethilio.eth, this 7 year old was one of the highlights of this devcon! He came in without an ens name, and left with his .eth, meeting 340 ENSers in the community and thoroughly reminding us at ENS why we do what we do. [pic.twitter.com/ryMkQ0HBnY](https://t.co/ryMkQ0HBnY)

#### Happy Hour

The ENS DAO Happy Hour was a huge hit!

A thank you to everyone who joined us and contributed to making it successful! It was a pleasure to host such a great group of frENS in this city.

If you missed it, we'll see you at the next one.🥳 ![](upload://tImKQBlxn6x6rIUHI2fgH457Xs7.jpeg)

#### Onboarding Events

ENS DAO organized and participated in several onboarding events during Devcon. Ecosystem Steward Validator.eth collaborated with [Ethereum Honduras](https://twitter.com/EthereumHN) to host an onboarding event at a venue nearby Agorá. Fellow Ecosystem Steward Slobo.eth also participated in an onboarding event.

Onboarding events are important education initiative for our Ecosystem and lead to the proliferation of ENS Protocol in the long run. We hope to see these and more community ran events soon!

### 📝 Protocol Developments

#### State of ENS

Founder and Lead Developer of the ENS Protocol, Nick.eth, gave his first "State of ENS" presentation in over three years. Below, we highlight the growth of the protocol since 2019:

|                          | October 2019 | October 2022 |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| **Integrations**         | 34           | 507          |
| **Active Registrations** | 310,000      | 2,500,000    |
| **Unique Addresses**     | 96,000       | 1,000,000    |
| **Registration Years**   | 66,700       | 6,500,000    |
| **ENS Treasury**         | 382 ETH      | 38,382 ETH   |

#### L(ENS)

On October 4th, LENS Protocol announced their partnership with ENS that allows Lens data to be queried via ENS resolution. This is a utilization of EIP-3668 offchain resolution (CCIP Read) that Coinbase recently integrated as well.

CCIP Read uses a gateway service model to fetch data offchain in real-time, so you can fetch LENS text record without delay. You can now look up your LENS profile on Metamask and also look it up via the ENS Manager App, as well as several other wallets.

#### 🖥️ ENS Manager App Update

The New ENS Manager App is now live on the Goerli test network and facilitates the following:

* Upload your avatar
* Select NFT
* Registration of multiple records
* Register wrapped names
* Burning fuses

This brings the Name Wrapper update one step closer to reality. For a more thorough breakdown, check out jefflau.eth's thread on Twitter:

> 1/ The new app is finally updated to support:\
> \
> \- avatar upload + nft select\
> \- registration w/ multiple records\
> \- registering wrapped names\
> \- burning fuses\
> \
> It’s rough around the edges, but one step closer to NameWrapper mainnet deployment!\
