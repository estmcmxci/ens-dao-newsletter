#### [ENS DAO Endowment Update](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-progress-update-nov-30/15502)

**@nick.eth** has provided a status update on the ENS DAO endowment.

_Karpatkey_ will begin preparing a plan for structuring and managing the endowment, aiming for a total of approximately $30 million in the Endowment fund to start.

_See the full post for more details:_ [Endowment progress update, Nov 30](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-progress-update-nov-30/15502)

\--

#### [Social Proposal: Routine DAO Treasury Management](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-routine-dao-treasury-management/15501)

**@nick.eth** has written a social proposal for Routine Treasury Management which grants the Lead Steward the responsibility of reviewing the state of the DAO‚Äôs accounts, regularly updating the DAO on their state, and making reports to the DAO whenever they judge that action from the DAO may be required.

The purpose of this proposal is to establish basic parameters around the DAO‚Äôs working capital / runway and the handling of revenue on an ongoing basis.

_Trivia: A Social Proposal asks for the agreement of the DAO on something that cannot be enforced on-chain. Examples of this include a proposal to change the royalty percentage for the ENS secondary market on OpenSea, or a petition to the root key holders. Social proposals have a quorum requirement of 1% and require a minimum approval of 50% to pass. For more information, review the_ [_Social Proposal Template_](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/blob/main/process/social-proposal-template.md) _and_ [_Governance Process_](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/process)_._

**Vitalik Buterin** (@vbuterin), co-founder of Ethereum, discussed the merits of the Ethereum identity ecosystem including ENS, Sign-in With Ethereum, and more, in his recent blog post titled [_What in the Ethereum application ecosystem excites me_](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/12/05/excited.html)_._

ENS is described as a key component of the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a way for users to easily interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications.

ENS allows anyone to register human-readable names that can be used to securely and conveniently send and receive transactions, while also providing the benefits of identity verification inherent in decentralized blockchain technology.
