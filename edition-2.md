Frontend & Solidity Developer, Jeff Lau (@jefflau.eth), has put forth a [draft proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep9-executable-change-to-exponential-premium-price-oracle/) to deploy a new Exponential Price Oracle Contract to replace the current Linear Price Oracle Contract (EP9). **Update:** the proposal has moved to a [Snapshot vote.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe040bdae812af4bd5b3b6e3f46ed1ff4701986c338b827ac8f05807c2b9b9d73)

**Update:** An additional proposal to Fund a DAO-Governed Identity Server for _Sign-in with Ethereum_ (EP10) has moved to a [Snapshot vote.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x104eb11d42813fadc2b408856e8fa2c10e34dbb4a87abaa2f089ece124263f16)

### üì∞ Working Group News

In a tremendous showing of support from the DAO, budget allocations were passed for all four Working Groups with over 90% in favor. The Working Groups continue to move forward with their specialized focuses.

If you would like to contribute to the development of ENS, [please contact a Steward.](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/q1-q2-2022-steward-announcement)

Our four groups are **Community**, **Ecosystem**, **Meta-Governance**, and **Public Goods**.

#### [üë• Community](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/community/12)

* The Community Stewards want to thank everyone who voted in the previous Snapshot window for the Working Group budgets. ENS DAO history is in the making, and we are glad to be sharing it with you. If you have any further budgetary needs, contact your lead coordinators or lead steward, @coltron.eth.
* The Community Office Hours on Twitter Spaces will now occur at 5 pm EST (10 pm UTC) every Thursday. We are planning pre-programmed topics with guests as often as possible. Follow the [@ens\_dao](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO) Twitter account to stay updated on notifications for these spaces. On Thursday (03/17), we will speak with @mmurthy of [Karma](https://twitter.com/showkarma\_xyz) about his DAO reputation system. These spaces are recorded for those who can not attend.
* The Community Working Group hosts a weekly onboarding call every Friday at 1:30 pm EST (6:30pm UTC). The goal of this call is to provide general information about the ENS DAO and direct new or existing contributors to working groups where their skills and interest align. [Google Meet link](https://meet.google.com/gvg-bkdk-xaa)
* The Learn Docs in Gitbook is now being actively worked on as a top priority. If you have experience with Gitbook or would like to help out, contact lead contributor @zadok7

#### üó∫Ô∏è _Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes_

* The Community WG is making strides in the greater Web3 LatAm & Iberian Communities; Lead Coordinator of subgroup _Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes_ @estmcmxci & contributor futurx.eth participated in the [W\&M Research DAO](https://stream.waterandmusic.com/s1-es/) Translation Working Group, led by [Mart√≠n Giraldo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martingiraldo/), translating over 25,000 words from English to Spanish.
* _Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes_ is dedicated to highlighting Web3 projects that focus on **accessibility, transparency and inclusivity.** More fleshed out translation initiatives help to break down barriers and creates on ramps for underserved communities to participate in Web3. [The W\&M Research DAO's](https://stream.waterandmusic.com/s1-es/) Translation Working Group translation initiative sets the example by becoming a multilingual DAO.

@estmcmxci on his initiatives for the LatAm & Iberian Communities:

> Feliz de participar en el [@ENS\_DAO](https://twitter.com/ENS\_DAO) como el mayordomo de la Comunidad Para Hispanohablantes!

### **Update:** ENS NFTs

* The ENS DAO is collaborating with Galaxis [(@Galaxisxyz)](https://twitter.com/Galaxisxyz) _(formerly Ether Cards)_ to launch a new seasonal NFT series. The first of 12 will be distributed for free on the Spring Solstice - March 20. Anyone who signed the ENS Constitution and has an email or twitter record qualifies. Snapshot is in less than 24 hours from this publication time!
* The NFTs are themed after Fae mythology and the significance of True Names. Each month's NFT will be distributed to 144 people who have participated in the ENS DAO ecosystem; keep an eye open for qualifying criteria for future months!
* Anyone who can collect all 12 is in for a special treat - it'll be possible to "forge" them all together into a single seasonally-changing NFT that represents the whole year.
* Nick Johnson (@nick.eth) will be [providing an update on his Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1503897319280111616) when the snapshot is taken, with a methodology for fairly selecting 144 winners at random.

### üñ•Ô∏è [Protocol Development](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-dev/42)

* [Ethers now has support for CCIP Read and ENS wildcard resolution!](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1503246417997230084)
  * CCIP Read enables off-chain storage with the source of truth being Ethereum.
  * Wildcard enables domains to resolve records for subdomains that don‚Äôt ‚Äúexist‚Äù yet.
* The [Exponential Price Oracle Contract](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep9-executable-change-to-exponential-premium-price-oracle/) to replace the current Linear Price Oracle Contract (EP9) has moved to draft proposal. **Update:** the proposal has moved to a [Snapshot vote.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe040bdae812af4bd5b3b6e3f46ed1ff4701986c338b827ac8f05807c2b9b9d73)

  * Name Wrapper
  * Reverse Registrar
  * ETH Registrar Controller
  * Public Resolver

### [ü§ù Onboard to the ENS DAO!](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/ens-dev/42)

* [Sync up](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/community-working-group-dashboard/11031) with our Community Working Group!
* Join our weekly onboarding call [every Friday at 1:30 pm EST (6:30pm UTC)](https://meet.google.com/bqc-nskn-rzu) to learn about our DAO, governance process, $ENS Tokens, and current projects.
* [Join on our Discord](https://chat.ens.domains) to chat about ENS or speak to a moderator.
* Visit our [Governance Docs](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/).

### üîí Security Tip

When speaking or transacting online, always make sure to verify (and even a second and third time) that it is with the person you believe it is. It has become common for bad actors to impersonate others on sites such as Twitter. Often the accounts will look identical, with the only difference being one letter in the username.

**Always exercise skepticism and diligence with matters involving irreversible cryptocurrency transactions.**

### üìà Market News

* According to the [Dune analytics dashboard](https://dune.xyz/makoto/dot-eth-revenue) by JavaScript and Solidity Developer, Makoto Inoue (@matoken.eth), February had 67095 new ENS registrations and 7634 renewals. This is approximately the same as January.
* Secondary market sales of rare ENS names continues to be very popular, and the first half of March was an exciting time in the market. According to the Twitter account [ENS Sales Bot](https://twitter.com/EnsSales/status/1500018166105313282), the top five .eth name sales of the past two weeks were:
  * hodl.eth - 55Œû (\~$140k)
  * ukraine.eth - 50Œû (\~$126k)
  * rug.eth - 34Œû (\~$85k)
  * anon.eth - 25Œû (\~$63k)
  * only.eth - 20Œû (\~$50k) _(exchange rate current as of March 14, 2022)_
* Bids were placed for usa.eth and defi.eth, both of which reached 100Œû (\~$252k) and were [rejected](https://twitter.com/EnsSales/status/1502577539105054720). These are among the highest secondary sale bids to date, and reflect the growing interest in ENS domains.
* [eth-leaderboard.eth](https://twitter.com/ethleaderboard) has posted stats for the top Twitter users displaying .eth names (by followers) for February, which included (as of March 7, 2022):
  * 64k profiles on [ethleaderboard.xyz](https://ethleaderboard.xyz)

  * Top 100 rank floor: 193.7k followers
  * Top 1000 rank floor: 17.9k followers
