### 🌀 ENS Labs Updates

#### NameWrapper Live on MainNet

On March 29th, 2023, jefflau.eth published EP3.5 - Activate new .eth Controller & Reverse Registrar; the long-awaited upgrade was executed with [99.99% voter approval](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42973781582803845389836855775840822719678533376883030929209752909248937768242).

![](upload://2qkoPdQ8AXQnVSiGHb60QBsJRvZ.jpeg)

> EP3.5 is now live on mainnet for [@ensdomains](https://twitter.com/ensdomains?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw)!\
> \
> I'm thrilled to have authored the bulk of these contracts along with much guidance from [@nicksdjohnson](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw). It brings a lot of UX boosts for ENS. We'll be testing the new app internally on mainnet and plan to release it within a week! 🚀

> EP 3.5 passed with 2.6m votes in favour! 🎉\
> \
> The proposal will be executed in just over 24 hours, upgrading the following contracts:\
> \- NameWrapper\
> \- ReverseRegistrar\
> \- ETHRegistrarController\
> \- PublicResolver[https://t.co/R585RxOsuR](https://t.co/R585RxOsuR) [pic.twitter.com/RBQkh2TKm3](https://t.co/RBQkh2TKm3)

> [\[EP3.5\] \[Executable\] Activate new .eth Controller and Reverse Registrar](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-5-executable-activate-new-eth-controller-and-reverse-registrar/16776): \[quote="jefflau.eth, post:1, topic:16776"] With the new Name Wrapper, we will add a new .eth controller that allows registering wrapped names directly as well as registering with multiple records and adding a reverse record in 1 transaction. This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.
>
> We will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.
>
> \[/quote]

We look forward to all the new builds that incorporate the new NameWrapper feature for ENS Domains.

#### Update on Gasless DNSSEC

Gasless DNSSEC is an integration that is currently being developed by the ENS Labs team. This will make it possible for anyone with a DNS name to ENS-enable it by setting DNS TXT records, with no onchain gas fees whatsoever. Currently, the integration is open for review, and more details can be found in the [pull request](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/pull/203).

However, a critical vulnerability was discovered in an undeployed version of the DNSSEC registrar code. This vulnerability could have allowed anyone to claim or update a DNSSEC name that was owned by another user. Fortunately, the bug was discovered before deployment and before any users were affected.

@Nick.eth recommended the @Ecosystem\_Stewards payout a $100,000 bug bounty for a critical vulnerability discovered in an undeployed version of the DNSSEC registrar code. Slobo.eth approved the payout and echoed Nick's gratitude to the submitter and others who are helping to find bugs in the code.

* For more information, visit the [bug bounty thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/new-dnssec-registrar-bounty/16746/13?u=estmcmxci).

#### Call for ENS Foundation Director

Brantly Millegan has expressed his desire to [resign](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/resignation-from-the-ens-foundation-effective-upon-the-election-of-a-replacement/16676/7) as a director, and the DAO will appoint a new director following a nomination process and election. [The announcement on the forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/call-for-nominees-ens-foundation-director/16858) outlines the process for nominating a new director for the ENS Foundation, a Cayman Islands incorporated foundation that represents the ENS DAO in the real world.

To be considered for election, you must receive 100,000 votes on Snapshot in support of your nomination.

#### Gitcoin Grants Beta Round

ENS DAO is sponsoring the upcoming Gitcoin Grants Beta Round utilizing Gitcoin's decentralized grants stack, Allo Protocol.

> The ENS Ecosystem DAO stewards [@AlexSlobodnik](https://twitter.com/AlexSlobodnik?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw), [@yambo\_eth](https://twitter.com/yambo\_eth?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw), and I are happy to announce we will be sponsoring the [@Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Program Beta Round utilizing the Allo protocol.\
> \
> Important Dates:\
> 4/12 - 4/21: Applications are open\
> 4/12 - 4/24: Grant Reviews\
> 4/25 - 5/9: Beta Rounds Live [https://t.co/SYoIXx41Rp](https://t.co/SYoIXx41Rp)

> — limes.eth, CPA (@EnlightenedLime) [April 12, 2023](https://twitter.com/EnlightenedLime/status/1646252678765223937?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The grants stack allows teams to deploy on-chain funding rounds in a trustless manner, but it comes with a cost of gas that needs to be paid every time records are updated or posted on the application.

To mitigate this, builders can post a preview of their project as a reply to @Limes' [thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/gitcoin-grants-beta-round/16884) to receive feedback and avoid mistakes before deploying on-chain. The ecosystem group may sponsor gas fees for deploying applications, but this is subject to the discretion of the stewards. Builders are advised to use this support judiciously.

* More details about the $50k sponsored round can be found on the [forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/gitcoin-grants-beta-round/16884).

**Key Dates**:

* Applications open: April 12 - April 21
* Review: April 12 - April 24
* Beta round: April 25 - May 9

#### Retroactive Grant: CCIP-read implementation on Starknet

In December 2022, Nethermind proposed to build a CCIP implementation for ENS on StarkNet, allowing effortless linking of StarkNet addresses to ENS domains. This will provide infrastructure for generalized CCIP-read for StarkNet, allow integration of StarkNet applications with ENS, and provide a cheap and trustless storage layer for registries.

Since their initial proposal, the Nethermind team have continued to provide updates on the development of the implementation, which can be found on the forum. The ENS DAO Ecosystem Stewards have provided a further retroactive grant of $20,000 USDC for their continued work on the implementation.

* For a review of the discussion, read the [forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ccip-implementation-for-ens-on-starknet/15691/10?u=estmcmxci).
